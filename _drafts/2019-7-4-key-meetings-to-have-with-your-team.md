## Purpose aka why am I writing this
The purpose of this article is to provide an introduction to - and a set of resources for - key meetings that managers should have with members of their team.

Each meeting breakdown contains important details, including:
- Meeting Name
- Purpose
- Agenda and topics
- Attendees
- Frequency
- Length of meeting
- Template (if applicable)
- Additional Resources

> To fight meeting proliferation, I conduct these meetings during the scheduled one-on-one meeting time.

So, for example, when you have a "goal review" meeting or a caree development converation this can (and should) be held during your standard one-on-one time. Another reason why the one-on-one meeting is the foundation.

### What this article is and isn't
Management cannot be boiled down to a few articles, slogans, and a TLDR.  With that said, this article is an introduction to key meetings we should be having as managers while providing additional resources.  Most of the information within this article is gathered from over 10 years of personal experience as a manager, learning from mentors, conversations with peers, and lots _(lots!)_ of reading.

So how should you use this article? Read about the meetings, check out the additional resources, and try it out. Experience is the best teacher!

## Who is this for?
Anyone and everyone who wants to position their team members and teams for success!

Wait? Seriously? Anyone _and_ everyone?

Yup!

This is for Managers who are looking for ways to connect further with their staff.  For first time managers learning the ropes. This is also for experienced managers who are looking for a refresher, a set of resources, or a guide that will help them train new managers.

This is also for makers who are or who may be curious of the meetings they are in. This is also for the makers who are holding their managers accountable and/or a guide for makers to know what to expect from a good manager!

Lastly, this is for my past self.  These are the meetings I wish I knew about - and I wish I knew how to conduct - when I first became a manager!

So yeah...everyone :)

## One-on-ones
**Purpose:** To provide support, coaching, and candor that helps your direct report grow, succeed, and excel.

**Brief Overview**  
The reigning, defending, undefeated meeting of the (management) world! The one-on-one. Yeah, the champ is here!  

One-on-ones (i.e. 1-1s) are the most valuable tool in your management utility belt and the most essential meeting to have with your direct report. These meetings help you remove roadblocks, coach, mentor, and develop your people - empowering them to become the most bad-ass versions of themselves!  

Yeah, these meetings are essential.

Fundamentally, one-on-ones (as with every meeting outlined) are for the employee, it is _their_ meeting. Listen, ask questions, and be present. Conduct them in private and ensure a safe space.

One-on-ones help us empathize, connect with, and better understand our direct reports - creating an enriched working environment and enhanced sense of belonging. Through one-on-ones we can also gain informal feedback and address morale issues, while ensuring better engagement, productivity, and reduced turnover.

> Conducting effective one-on-ones is the single most important investment you can make in your team.

One-on-ones are the lifeblood of an open, healthy, and effective working relationship. The other meetings outlined in this article flow out of this one.  If you are having great one-on-ones it will make the other meetings that much more productive!

**Agenda and topics**:
  - The agenda is driven by the direct report.
    - Here is a great link to share with your direct reports on [preparing for an effective one-on-one with your manager](https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/01/03/7-ways-to-prepare-for-an-effective-one-on-one-meeting-with-your-manager/)
    - As a manager come prepared with questions; take notes, keep promises, and follow up
  - Topics include: priorities, roadblocks, accomplishments, frustrations, feedback, and what is "top of mind" for your direct report; it is _not_ a status update

**Frequency**: weekly, bi-weekly (based on [task relevant maturity](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/management-concept/))

**Meeting Length**: 30-60 minutes

## Skip Level Meetings
**Purpose:** To understand better how your managers are performing and to learn more about/further support your team members. _(edit this wording)_

**Brief Description:**  
The first cousin to the 1-1 is the skip-level meeting. I was first introduced to this concept when reading Camille Fournier's book ["The Manager's Path"](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897)

When you are a manager of managers it is important to understand
- How your managers are performing
- How people are doing under your managers
- Are there any process/performance issues that are being "managed up", which you do not have insight to

For skip level meetings you meet with the direct reports of your managers. The objectives and structure of this meeting is analogous to the weekly 1-1.  

**Agenda and topics:**
- TBD

**Frequency:**: monthly, quarterly

**Meeting Length:** 30-60 minutes

**Additional Resources:**
- TBD

## Three month catch up
**Purpose:** To conduct an informal "mini-review" of the employee's first three months at the organization to better understand strengths, areas of improvement, and what this person has liked/disliked over the first few months. A "level-set".

**Brief Description:**  
For new hires and especially junior engineers starting their first job, I have introduced a "three month catchup". This meeting provides the opportunity to sit down with a new employee in a more focused session. A developer starting their first job may.

When things are going well this meeting helps to promote continued flow. When things are not going well it provides an opportunity to provide constructive feedback in a more formal manner. At times I have utilized meeting as a mini performance review. If you are conducting frequent one-on-ones (as I know you are) then this meetings will be pretty straight forward

1-2 weeks before the meeting, I conduct a quick 10-15 minute overview discussion of the meeting. Where we go over the agenda and topics.

When things are not going well I have used this meeting as a forum to focus on areas of improvements. It is important to address areas where someone is performing below expectation early and directly.

**Agenda and topics:**
- Understand what this person has enjoyed and not enjoyed working on in the first three months
- Discuss strengths and areas of improvement. Start with self reflection, what does this person feel?
- Outline goals for the next 9-12 months
- See the [Meeting Template](https://github.com/ajahne/essential-manager-meetings/blob/master/templates/three-month-catch-up.md) for a detailed outline.

**Frequency:** 1 time. Three months after start date with new hire

**Meeting Length:** 45 minutes

## Goal Reviews
**Purpose:** To review your direct report's current goals and ensure we are accurately tracking towards them.

**Brief Description:**  
Having a performance review is only one component of meeting goals.

Have you ever had a conducted a performance review where you set up shiny new goals for the upcoming year only to never review them again until the next performance review?

Has there ever been a disconnect between the goals you laid out and what the person actually worked on?

Maybe priorities changed throughout the year (they will) or maybe now a new strategic initiative needs to be added to the roadmap (it will). Things that seemed so important in January may have turned irrelevant in June. How do you ensure alignment between the company vision, team goals with this person's personal goals and motivations?

**Agenda and topics:**
- TBD

**Frequency:** monthly (with more junior people or people new to their role), quarterly (with more senior/experienced staff)

**Meeting Length:** 30-60 minutes (dependent on frequency). If monthly, 30 minutes. If quarterly, allocate more time as necessary.  

**Additional Resources:**
- TBD

## Career Development Conversations
**Purpose:** To better understand (and support) your direct report's motivations and career aspirations.

**Brief Description:**  
From Radical Candor
 > Get to know each of your direct reports better, learn what their aspirations are, and plan how to help them achieve those dreams.

While performance reviews are backward looking, career development conversations are forward facing.

Have you ever wondered the following about your teammates (and if not, you should!)
- what motivates you?
- what career goals do you have?
- what inspired you to enter this field?

Once we understand what motivates our people and what their goals are; we can help them achieve them.

But wait, I hear you saying, what if their career goals don't align with the position or the company's trajectory? Won't asking about these goals create dissonance between this person and the organization?

Whoa, whoa, whoa. If that dissonance exists, it exists independent of this meeting. Wouldn't it be great to acknowledge any dissonance before this person is demotivated or worse and starts looking for (or actually takes) another opportunity?

I believe our role as managers is to help each member of our team be the most awesome version of themselves and support them on this journey. Career Conversations are a critical tool that helps get us there.

Career conversations are ongoing discussions that help you identify your direct reports professional goals and the steps needed to achieve them. Life story (past); Dreams (present); Career Action Plan

**Agenda and topics:**
- Conduct three ~60 minute conversations 2 weeks apart
  - Meeting One: Life Story - take an hour to get to know your employees
  - Meeting Two: Dreams - find their lighthouse, bring it into focus
  - Meeting Three: Career Action Plan - lay out the beacons to the lighthouse
- Use this [template]((https://github.com/ajahne/essential-manager-meetings/blob/master/templates/career-conversations.md)) as a guide to the three conversations and see the additional resources below for further details
- Using the goal reviews meeting is a great way to ensure we are tracking accurately on our Career Action Plan.

**Frequency:** 3 conversations, approximately 2 weeks apart from each other

**Meeting Length:** 60 minutes (a total of about 180 minutes for all three meetings)

## Performance Reviews
**Purpose:** Objective: reflect on performance from the last year.

**Brief Description:**  
Advice for managers:
- give yourself plenty of time to write these reviews.  It will take time to gather feedback, speak to peers, review your notes, and draft the full review
- keep notes throughout the year. When this person excels or performs below expectations on a task/goal/expectation make note of it.  When you receive feedback on this person from their peers or other managers, make note of it.
- Have an example for each piece of feedback. Feedback without an example does not resonant and in my opinion should can come across like an opinion versus an objective observation.

**Agenda and topics:**
- TBD

**Frequency:** once a year

**Meeting Length:** 60-90 minutes

**Additional Resources:**
- TBD
