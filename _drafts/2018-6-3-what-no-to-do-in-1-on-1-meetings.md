# outline
- 10 1-1 Do's and Don'ts
- provide TL;DR that is a TOC
- intro: why am I laying this out?
- breakdown each one with examples:
  - provide example
  - why should you not do this/why this is an issue
  - solutions if you find yourself doing it
- conclusion
- additional references


## 1-1 Don'ts:

## Do not just focus on tasks
The purpose

## Do not let them turn into never-ending therapy sessions

## Do not do all of the talking
So you're excited, your day is going well.  That new product launched to production with no errors, the CD pipeline has consistently performed in under 37 minutes, and.

This.  Is.  Not.  Your.  Time.  Say it with me...(in your head is fine).  This is not your time.  It is their time.  As leaders as are generally a bit (*cough*) outspoken.  We get excited, we want to share, we want to motivate someone with our eloquent points of wisdom and insight.  Avoid this.  Instead, ask questions.  Listen.  Take notes.  Learn more about the person you are working with and supporting.

I recently went to a baseball game with a colleague of mine who works in the tech industry as well.  As we were talking shop, he told me that his team recently hired a new lead as the previous lead was promoted.  I asked him how it was going and if they were having 1-1s (I wanted to get insight into how others do it).  He said yes, they were having 1-1s, but that his manager did all the talking.  Each time he came into the meeting almost ready to prove that he belonged, that he should be the tech lead, that he was smart enough to lead the team.  He never asked questions or tried to build a rapport.  It caused my colleague to lose interest in the meetings, essentially shutting down during the 1-1s. You are a caring, open, good-hearted manager.  Don't be this guy.


## Do not cancel and avoid rescheduling
1-1 meetings are important.  Rescheduling meetings as a manager can be frustrating to your direct report as it impacts their day and can also impact morale and motivation.  Have you ever had a performance review or an important meeting that was rescheduled by your boss?  Have you ever had something important to bring up, something that you wanted to discuss during a meeting that was shifted to another day or cancelled?  How did it feel? Not so good, right? We have all had that happen and must avoid moving meetings, especially 1-1s.  

Now people get sick, go on vacation, have PTOs.  Servers go down and fires need to be put out.  Changing a meeting (rarely) is understood.  Doing so consistently is a red flag and a failure as a leader.

If the meetings are "boring" or not productive, I'm sorry to tell you, but that's on you.  Bad 1-1s are the fault of manager, not the direct report.  Here are some additional questions you can ask to spice things up.  Below you will find some recipes to switch up the formula.

## Do not schedule them back to back
I learned this one the hard way.  When you first begin as a team or tech lead, you may have management responsibilities that include conducting 1-1s. In my case, I chose one day where I would have all of my 1-1s.  This plan was glorious.  I would know each week when I would meet with everyone, I would conduct all my 1-1s have productive meetings with all of my direct reports and conquer everything in one day.  I would go into the day mentally prepared, have a clear schedule,

After doing it for a few months I was beat.  I would go into the day mentally prepared, but after the third 1-1 I was mentally exhausted.

> 1-1s are critical, fundamental relationship building meetings.  Give yourself the time, space, and energy to ensure you are focused and "in the moment" during each one.

The lesson? Do not overbook your time as you need mental breaks too.  1-1s can be light, upbeat affairs.  They can also be heavy and intense discussions.  Going from one meeting to the next to the next, will not give you the space to be your best, which will in turn have negative impact on the person you are meeting with.

My personal rule now is to ensure I do not book back to back meetings, have at least 30 minutes in between, and have no more than three 1-1s in a day.


## Dos:
- do have them
- do switch them up
- do focus on the moment and be present
- do take notes
- do come prepared

## Other:
- do not undervalue them
- do not let them get stuck in a rut
- do not think having 1-1s is a panacea
- do not avoid the hard conversations
- do reflect on them
- do ask for feedback

## Notes:
Reflections on 1-1 meetings

I have been conducting 1-1 meetings in various capacity with numerous members of our engineering term for over 7 years. These meetings have evolved significantly over this time. As members of the team grow into tech leads and managers I have begun to reflect on 1-1s in an effort to help guide new managers and to also self assess and improve the meetings I have.

Reflections on 1-1
Have them, have them weekly
- if you are not having 1-1, then you should. From my perspective, 1-1s are critical because...

Conduct them in private
- so now you're having them, great. In order to get the most out if meeting, ensuring
Switch them up
- if not monitored, these meetings can easily

Take notes

Be present
We have all been in meetings that we may not have wanted to be in. Sometimes we are tired, not feeling well, maybe there are pressing matters outside of work that are on your mind. We may gaze

Worked to schedule 1-1s at a time that works for both parties. Are you a morning person? Does your direct report have a packed Thursday?

Originally I tried to have "meeting days" and "development days". This didn't scale as the size of the team grew. Instead I have spread my meetings across all days throughout the work. As my team and I prefer morning meetings,

Write about meetings
Write about my schedule

Avoid rescheduling and canceling
- these meetings matter, do your best to not reschedule or cancel the meeting

Have an agenda
- in my experience it is best

Assess the meeting over time
There are different meetings for different people
Listen
