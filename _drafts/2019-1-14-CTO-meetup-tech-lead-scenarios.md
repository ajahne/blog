Four scenarios
- Velocity + tech debt
- On boarding  
- Customer pressure
- Team metrics

OKR
KPI

Product Metrics:
- Usage
- Conversions
- Research
- A/B
- Business objects
- Number of users
- Number of new users/sign up
- Company wide
- KPIs for business
- OKRs to engineering outcomes
- A/B testing
- Data impact
- Lead time for changes
- Quality of estimates
- Number of stores
- Bugs
- Tech debt
- What is your trend?
- Hours work
- Time work onboard
- Animosity (turnover, survey, glassdoor review, time of meetings, “yes and”)

Research
- what you research is in the product
- ROI
- Optimizations, iterate to see some goal, can we scale to this? Have to have a goal (eg support 100x users)
- Hypothesis testing (trying to scale); how quickly can we validate the new idea
- A/B testing
- Developer productivity

Code climate, git prime
Mean time to restore
Lead time for changes
Frequency of release



Operations
- system uptime
- Number of failures
- Numbers of requests
- Help-desks
- Meant time to restore
- Infra

Quality
- Bugs you have
- Speed of delivery
- Automated testing
- Market fit
- Working as intended
- Accessibility (people with disabilities)
- Sprint to sprint how much time is spent on fixing bugs

Platform
- Level of Documentation (API etc)
- Lead time for changes
- Test coverage (integration testing)


Other groups
Someone deceive high points:

Onboarding
- issues: checklist for accounts permissions and having everything setup ahead of time vs doing it Adhoc
- Social aspect: having a mentor to socilizw them, slack bot called donut
- Onboarding epic
- Setup 1-1 meetings with team member
- Pair programming
- What are the useful artifacts (eg technology diagrams)
- Key aspects of the system
- Everyone’s first story was to document true language (document, onboard)
-

Tech debt
- champions, get one person involved (dominoes start to fall)
- One change vs striking changes
- Most customers change where they shop (birth marriage)
- New blood (someone new onto the team)
- Getting people excited for change
- Team structure (too many heads and who should be followed)
- Code quality? Is it measured? Any responsibility for it?
- New team members
- Is there any type of documentation?
- System in place?
- What is the culture? Assessing architecture and code
- Some devs be feature devs and some are bug devs
- Cons: some people leave because they now have process and did not want
- Cons: runway. How do you get time to do it?
- Cons: introduce further slowness
- Cons: how to get people on board
- Cons: did you take someone spot as a tech lead
- Maybe PM is brand new and does not know how to prioritize
- What is the experience level? Maybe you need more or better people
- First: understand pressures you are working with
- What is the technical vision, how much time is it going to take you
- Ask the team why they are slowing down and have more bugs?
- Product manager pushed new features (had speed that was expected); always a balance between going for what PM wants or what the tech needs? In reality it’s a mix. To improve and add features is a balance.
- Lots of communication is required

Deliver product a month sooner
- agreed to do it
- Make first sale to get bonus
- First way: focus on primary features and deliver next set through bug fixes
- Develop a small set of features first
- Hack up a first version
- Work extra hours
- Reprioritize pipeline
- Focus on scope and minimize scope with a slightly less scope (quality over quantity)
- If partner client (move mountains to make it happen); as company moves forward cannot be sales driven in isolation and understand timeline and scope; can’t keep cutting time off from developers
- Supply tech lead at a client
- Do not sign up to do the impossible
- Can we pair down?
- Technical quality? Feature quality?


Non functional aspects
- What are common non functional elements (performance); process or mechanism to address
Overwhelmed tech lead friend
- drowning, deliver software and more responsibility, deliverables have slipped. What would you want to know
Tech leads
- formulate delivery plan, create a high level delivery plan
- Put together a kitchen in a new house
Inherited a team of 7 engineers
- release once every 2 weeks, Blocked by FE engineers
- Complete less than 55%


Non functional
- performance
- Testing
- Accessibility
- CI/CD
- Optimize for: deployment frequency, lead time for changes, Mean Time To Restore (MTTR), change failure rate
- Getting apps through the AppStore
- Unified code base (e.g. not a separate code base per App Store); what is the programming language to use
- Test end points
- Cloud deployments
- IAC (terraform)
- TTL is (deployment frequency)
- Strong team communications
- Sprints
- Development Processes
- User stories and requirement gathering
- Product roadmap
- Choosing tools based on hiring and and retention
- Cost (infrastructure)
- Privacy
- PII
- Developer experience
- Regalatory

Vishal

Start as samurais, end as kids with scissores


Go again:
-
-
Technical lead
- manage up effectively
- Can someone do more instead of him doing the work
- More judicious with meetings
- Delegate
- Process and learning
- Introspective: is this really a good fit
- Identify problems and possible ways out
- Is he successfully mentoring
- Is he hanging onto work too much
- Is team able to do all of the work
- What does he want to prioritize?
- Clarify role and expectations with management
- Communicating upwards, not be single point of failure: eg bigger team or more people
- Value management

Low velocity
- get product and QA on the same page
- Hire more people
- API quality
- Team building
- Vertical teams
- Release often with less

Build a kitchen with Agile
- have stakeholders
- Set requirements
- Build and QA and done stages
- Create plan and present vision for the team
