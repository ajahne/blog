# Interrupt Driven Work
# Block out time and respect it

One time management challenge that I have personally struggled with and seen others struggled with it as well - is how to balance you time the more senior you get in your career. In my experience, The first time this starts to impact engineers is when they first become a Tech Lead (link to TL)

As you gain more experience you begin to have more meetings and need to balance heads down (i.e. deep work) time with meetings.

A typical TL with have some, all, or more than the following responsibilities:
- Architecture and technical design build and review time
- hands on programming for critical projects or ongoijng work streams
- Code and system design review
- Rubber ducking with teammates
- 1:1s with engineers on the team as a mentor and to up-level teammates
- Meetings with TLs are partners teams
- A myriad of slacks, messages, emails


This is the first time many engineers in their career have to deal with interrupt driven work.

In this scenario you may find yourself working extra hours or missing deadlines or stressed.

The biggest advice I have for folks starting on this path is to learn how to say "no"
> Learn to say "no"

Sometimes saying no, maybe ultimately be a "yes and". For example, "Yes I can review the technical by Wednesday and I will need to take on less story points for the first half of this sprint". I'll write more on this in a future post, however, I think its an important skill to learn how to say no and say "yes and".

## Block out your calendar
As more of your time is required in more areas, its critcal to begin blocking out your time (and respecting it).

One skill that is noq required in this role is (improved) calendar management. At a high level, now is the time to begin blocking out your calendar for deep work time to minimize the interruptions.

## A few techniques I have tried

## Static Planning Days have themes
One thing that I tried early on in my career was to block out days based on themes. For example
- Monday and Wednesday - Meeting Days
- Tuesday and Thursday - Programming Days
- Friday - Flex

### Pros
- mentally clear on what my focus is on each day
- teammates are clear on my avaiability and focus

### Cons
- Pretty rigid: What if I have critical meetings on Tuesday?
- Can lead to frustration and planning challenges when you expect to architect the new redesign on Thursday, but you need to meet with cross-functional partners and teammates
- As the number of meetings grows it can start to eat into the dedicated technical days


## Dynamic Planning
Another technique I have tried is to plan out my calendar based on the needs of the week. For example, each week on Sunday or Monday after Monday planning meetings (e.g. sprint planning) I would have sense of the outcomes for the week and update my calendar accordingly with blocked out time for heads down time and

### Pros
- A more "agile" approach that allows me to plan the week based on what I need (sometimes more meetings, sometimes more heads down time)


### Cons
- requires a bit more time to plan each week
- Possibly too disurptive to teamates if you are dynamically changing whens standing meetings (e.g. 1-1s) occur


When I was head of engineering at at startup a few years back, I worked with an engineer who took on the role of Tech Lead (and eventually manager). They struggled with balancing meetings with heads down work. I worked with them to put busy blocks on their calendar.

After a few weeks, they were still struggling to get sufficient heads down time. One observation  I noticed is they were holding 1-1s and meeting during "programming" blocks.  My feedback was, respect your time, do not let people book over it. A one off is ok, but do not let it become regular

## Offense
what is it?
- have a meeting with other people, schedule the meeting first for a time that is more convenive for your scheudle

anti-pattern
- this does not mean schedule it at 9am your time, which is 6am someone else's time.
- Scheduling a time that is inconvient for someone else - calendar etiqutte is still important

how this has helped me?
- I have family time block on my calendar each time. Sometimes when I ask someone to put a 1-1 onn my calendar, there have been times when it has gone pretty close to dinner time on the EST. So Instead, I typically take the lead


## Defensive
What is it?
- Put blocks on your calendar when you need heads down time, are unaivable to meet, or need to focus.

anti-pattern
- having to many busy blocs on your calendar so noone can find time to meet with you.

To start each of my days I put a "heads down block". I also look ahead during the current week and into the next 2-3 weeks. I have a sense of the goals / outcomes I would like to accomplish. This allows me to ensure I have sufficient focus time on my calendar. I found that if I do not do this, I do not have extended periods of focus time.

Additionally, if I do not do this, I an get back to back meetings with no break or opportunity to have lunch!

Here is an example calendar
