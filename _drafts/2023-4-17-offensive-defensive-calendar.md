# Interrupt Driven Work
# Block out time and respect it

One time management challenge that I have personally struggled with and seen others struggled with it as well - is how to balance you time the more senior you get in your career. In my experience, The first time this starts to impact engineers is when they first become a Tech Lead (link to TL)

As you gain more experience you begin to have more meetings and need to balance heads down (i.e. deep work) time with meetings.

A typical TL with have some, all, or more than the following responsibilities:
- Architecture and technical design build and review time
- hands on programming for critical projects or ongoing work streams
- Code and system design review
- Rubber ducking with teammates
- 1:1s with engineers on the team as a mentor and to up-level teammates
- Meetings with TLs are partners teams
- A myriad of slacks, messages, emails


This is the first time many engineers in their career have to deal with interrupt driven work.

In this scenario you may find yourself working extra hours or missing deadlines or stressed.

The biggest advice I have for folks starting on this path is to learn how to say "no"
> Learn to say "no"

Sometimes saying no, maybe ultimately be a "yes and". For example, "Yes I can review the technical by Wednesday and I will need to take on less story points for the first half of this sprint". I'll write more on this in a future post, however, I think its an important skill to learn how to say no and say "yes and".

## Block out your calendar
As more of your time is required in more areas, its critical to begin blocking out your time (and respecting it).

One skill that is noq required in this role is (improved) calendar management. At a high level, now is the time to begin blocking out your calendar for deep work time to minimize the interruptions.

## A few techniques I have tried

## Static Planning Days have themes
One thing that I tried early on in my career was to block out days based on themes. For example
- Monday and Wednesday - Meeting Days
- Tuesday and Thursday - Programming Days
- Friday - Flex

### Pros
- mentally clear on what my focus is on each day
- teammates are clear on my availability and focus

### Cons
- Pretty rigid: What if I have critical meetings on Tuesday?
- Can lead to frustration and planning challenges when you expect to architect the new redesign on Thursday, but you need to meet with cross-functional partners and teammates
- As the number of meetings grows it can start to eat into the dedicated technical days

## Dynamic Planning
Another technique I have tried is to plan out my calendar based on the needs of the week. For example, each week on Sunday or Monday after Monday planning meetings (e.g. sprint planning) I would have sense of the outcomes for the week and update my calendar accordingly with blocked out time for heads down time and

### Pros
- A more "agile" approach that allows me to plan the week based on what I need (sometimes more meetings, sometimes more heads down time)

### Cons
- requires a bit more time to plan each week
- Possibly too disurptive to teamates if you are dynamically changing whens standing meetings (e.g. 1-1s) occur


When I was head of engineering at at startup a few years back, I worked with an engineer who took on the role of Tech Lead (and eventually manager). They struggled with balancing meetings with heads down work. I worked with them to put busy blocks on their calendar.

After a few weeks, they were still struggling to get sufficient heads down time. One observation  I noticed is they were holding 1-1s and meeting during "programming" blocks.  My feedback was, respect your time, do not let people book over it. A one off is ok, but do not let it become regular


## What I do now

I actually use a hybrid of these two approaches.  I currently schedule recurring 1-1s; syncs with my EMs, and a few team meetings. In between these types I find opportunities to put heads down (i.e. "busy") blocks on my calendar. This allows me to have standing meetings and plan around those to reduce thrash for myself and folks that I work with as well as providing me sufficient blocks of time to focus.

## Offense
what is it?
- have a meeting with other people, schedule the meeting first for a time that is more convenient for your schedule

anti-pattern
- this does not mean schedule it at 9am your time, which is 6am someone else's time.
- Scheduling a time that is inconvenient for someone else - calendar etiquette is still important

how this has helped me?
- I have family time block on my calendar each time. Sometimes when I ask someone to put a 1-1 onn my calendar, there have been times when it has gone pretty close to dinner time on the EST. So Instead, I typically take the lead


## Defensive
What is it?
- Put blocks on your calendar when you need heads down time, are unavailable to meet, or need to focus.

anti-pattern
- having to many busy blocs on your calendar so noone can find time to meet with you.

To start each of my days I put a "heads down block". I also look ahead during the current week and into the next 2-3 weeks. I have a sense of the goals / outcomes I would like to accomplish. This allows me to ensure I have sufficient focus time on my calendar. I found that if I do not do this, I do not have extended periods of focus time.

Additionally, if I do not do this, I can get back to back meetings with no break or opportunity to have lunch!

Here is an example calendar

# Heads Down Time

As I was scaling and growing as a manager, my lead at the time gave me advice that I cherish to this days

> Have a least one hour a day of heads down time


My lead at the time pushed me to do this. She urged me to rearrange my calendar and revisit my priorities.  

While I am a night person, I typically feel most productive with deep work in the morning of my days. So what I did was carve out 1 hour at the start of each day. To do this, I had to move a few 1-1s to later in the day or later in the week.

So what is heads down time? For me, this is thinking time, reading time, plan time, deep work time. I have heads down time 5 days a week to start my day.

It was tough to get this time, so what did I have to do
- I moved around 1-1s, instead of going all 1-1s across one (or two days) I spread them out across the week. This allowed me to have more time in the morning of each day to prepare for the day, read, or have thinking times
- I also blocked this time out on my calendar and named it "heads down time", definitely a little pithy, but I wanted to be transparent with how I would spend my time.


How do I spend my heads down times
- Monday is planning for the week
I look at my TODOs for the week, I also review my todos from last week.

I had to cut certain meetings out of my calendar
- large recurring meetings, I had to revisit and determine whether I was needed in these meetings or not. If I was needed, I also took it as an opportunity to review and see if this was a meeting that I could use as a growth opportunity for the TL of my team or another engineer.

- Where appropriate, I also merged 1-1s into group meetings. For example, instead of having two 30 minutes 1:1s each with my product partner and my design partner, I merged these meetings into one hour long meeting. This also help to reduced silos and ensure clear communication.
