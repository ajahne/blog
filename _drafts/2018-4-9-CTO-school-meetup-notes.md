## Self-sufficient teams/replacing yourself
- talk about vision quarterly
- tell team members they have ownership (make it explicit)
- hire people who are self-starters
- spread the knowledge
- educate people on the codebase by having them edit parts of the code they are not familiar with
  -  "monitor me while I fix it"
  - conduct "lunch and learns" or "coffee and code"
- have someone try out your role, step away
  -  for example, if you are the scrum master, have someone else try it for a sprint or two
    
 
## Diversity in hiring
- at its core, it is about the culture you create
- what benefits does your company offer (e.g. gender confirmation surgery, sponsoring hackathons, maternity/paternity leave)
- start mentorship programs
- reach out to community groups (e.g. coalition for queens)
- widen the funnel
 - for example: instead of only hiring developers from 4 years programs, check out developers from code academy as well
- expand your network
- go to career fairs
- open up new types of roles (for example, if you only have senior engineers, maybe open up a new junior position)
