# Outline
- what is clean code?
- why do we care (i.e why do we want clean code)?
- clean code points
- conclusion
- additional resources

## clean code
- Naming - clarity is king
- use intention-revealing names
- levels of abstraction (step down rule)
- function/file size
- functions - do one thing (SRP)
- function names should say what they do
- if statements - replace with functions
