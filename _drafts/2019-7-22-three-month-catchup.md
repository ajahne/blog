**Purpose:** To conduct an informal "mini-review" of the employee's first three months at the organization to better understand strengths, areas of improvement, and what this person has liked/disliked over the first few months.

**Overview:**  
For new hires and especially junior engineers starting their first job, I have introduced a "three month catchup". This meeting provides an opportunity to sit down with a new employee in a more focused session.

When things are going well this meeting helps to promote continued flow. When things are not going well it is an opportunity to provide constructive feedback in a more formal manner. At times I have utilized this meeting as a "mini [performance review](https://ajahne.github.io/blog/leadership/2019/07/24/essential-meetings-to-have-with-your-people-as-a-manager.html#performance-reviews)". If you are conducting frequent [one-on-ones](https://github.com/ajahne/one-on-ones) (as I know you are!) then this meetings will be pretty straight forward with no surprises. However, I find it important to carve out time specifically for the employee to voice their thoughts on the new job/role in a more concentrated way.

One to two weeks before the meeting, I conduct a quick 10-15 minute overview discussion of the meeting, where we go over the agenda and topics. This is an opportunity for your direct report to discuss in more detail than a standard 1-1 how the first three months of their job have been.  

**Agenda and topics:**
- Understand what your direct report has enjoyed and not enjoyed working on in the first three months.
- Discuss strengths and areas of improvement. Start with self reflection, what does this person feel?
- See the [meeting template](https://github.com/ajahne/essential-manager-meetings/blob/master/templates/three-month-catch-up.md) for a detailed outline.

**Frequency:** One time, three months after start date with new hire.

**Meeting Length:** 30-45 minutes.
