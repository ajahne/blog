Time management is hard. Its a skill that we will utilize in every phase of our career.  As I progressed in my career from developer, to tech lead, to VP time management has become that much more critical at each step. I wish I could tell you that it gets easier over time.  Nope, sorry.  What I can say is that experience will help you understand areas of how you manage your time that you may want to reflect on.  

One of my biggest learnings as it relates to my own time management, is to take time (ha) to reflect on how I am spending my time.  I typically try something out for specified period, be it 1 week, a quarter, or 6 months, then take a step back and reflect on what worked and what didn't. If there is one thing that has helped me improve my time management, is taking the opportunity to self reflect and and  measure my own performance.  

I did this recently to improve how I was organizing my calendar as it related to my 1-1 sessions

## My previous setup
I booked my first 1-1 on a Friday at 11:30am. I chose Friday because as the last day of the week, it felt like the perfect point to recap.  To catchup. To discuss the previous week and look forward to the next.  

As the prototype proved successful, I setup my second 1-1 on Friday as well. Then my third.

As I began to manage more and more people, I began to carve out more time on Fridays and conduct my meetings then.  As this was the early years of my 1-1s, the agendas ranged from deep dives into code, to discussions on performance, to frustrations, wins, exercise, movies, and the latest Final Fantasy game.

For a period of 3-4 years, I followed a similar schedule. I split up my week with "meeting" days and "development" days.  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday were meeting days, Tuesday and Thursday (the even days) were development days (i.e. when I got "even" with code).  During this time I was directly responsible for a team between 3-7, with about 5 weekly 1-1 meetings with individual contributors.

At a high level my days looked like this:
- Monday: Staff meeting, frontend team meeting, backend meeting, Stand ups, weekly planning
- Tuesday: Code Review, Development
- Wednesday: Task follow ups, Weekly lunch w/COO, Strategic vision/long term Planning
- Thursday: Code Review, R&D, Documentation
- Friday: Weekly 1-1s, Team lunch (monthly), additional meetings

During this time, I would say my weeks were (roughly):
- 40% meetings (stand-ups, 1-1s, clients, managerial, etc)
- 40% programming + R&D (including code reviewing)
- 20% strategic planning

This schedule worked for a while and had many benefits
- I knew going into each day what the general focus was
- Team members had a clear sense of what my meetings days were and we scheduled accordingly
- It gave me full days to dive right into code (hold this thought)

However, as the team grew and my responsibilities expanded, this setup did not scale

> As your responsibilities change, your calendar will need to change with it.  It will have to grow and evolve to fit your new role.  This will happen multiple times throughout your career and you have to be open to it.  What worked to get your here, will not work to get you there.

## How this setup did not scale
So what happens if when there are client calls on Tuesday? What happens when Monday is a holiday? What if there is an issue from a release on Wednesday that we need to discuss on Thursday? I cannot push this to Friday, its urgent, we need to discuss. What if code review is needed on Wednesday, someone is absent and needs to reschedule a meeting.  What if the R&D needs more than just one day (it will!).

Worst of all - from my standpoint - was that I was started to get burned out.  My Fridays began to be overwhelming.  Some Fridays would have as many as 8 to 10 meetings, with the majority of these being 1-1s. As my team grew I was trying to squeeze more and more 1-1s on Friday.  In the beginnings, Fridays work for 1-1 meetings as a nice "catch up" from the week.  But as I evolved as a manager and learned and grew, I quickly realized that 1-1s need to be more than just "task catchups".  

My Fridays would sometimes have five 1-1 meetings setup back to back, with no breaks in between.  Sometimes the meetings would run over and then I would need to push back meetings and it would cascade.  I can only imagine how frustrating this might have been for my direct reports. Additionally, as vacations and PTOs frequently fall on Fridays, these days would have to be rescheduled throughout the week.

There would be Fridays when I was exhausted by 2pm, mental energy spent. Yet, there would be more meetings. I started to find myself less able to give my all in meetings. More irritable, less focused. I was doing myself and the team a disservice

When most of my responsibility revolved around managing two to three developers, programming and developing systems (through hands on programming).

As your responsibilities change, your calendar will need to change with it.  It will have to grow and evolve to fit your new role.  This will happen multiple times throughout your career and you have to be open to it.  What worked to get your here, will not work to get you there. I was witnessing this first hand and make to switch it up.

## Time for a change
The importance of taking a moment to reflect cannot be overstated. Self-reflection has benefited me many times over my career and this instance was no difference.  After a few weeks of being exhausted on Friday, I knew I had to make a change.  I stepped away from my laptop, turned off my phone and went analog.  Pulled out pen and paper and wrote down what I was doing well and what I was not.

I was critical of myself.     

I realized that programming no longer was the most important part of my role. I could no longer reolved my schedule around "getting even with code".  Once again I had to let go, evolve and focus on what is most important.  The people.  

The worst thing to do in a 1-1 meeting is to not be present.  Sure, physically you may be there, but if you are not there mentally its bad for both parties.  The person you are meeting with can tell you aren't really there.  What if they had something really important to bring up? What if they were feeling that this position wasn't for them, wanted to talk about it, and on that day you were just not "there".  And I know, we are all human.  Managers, leaders, we get worn down too, we have bad days.   However, if I have a bad day it can cascade and ripple down into my direct reports.  We've all had those times.

Well, I had to minimize these.  I had to reduce this.  So what did I do.

I completely changed my schedule (gasp).

I knew Mondays and Fridays were becoming overwhelming.  Previously I revolved my schedule around when I could program and fit everything else around it.  Now? I prioritized my people, rescheduling 1-1s, and revolving everything else around these meetings.

### This process had a few steps:
- Internal reflection followed by scribbling out a future calendar
- Speaking candidly with my direct reports. I told them how I was shifting my schedule to better focus on being "present" in these meetings
  - This is a huge point, honesty goes a long way.  I feel it helped strengthen bonds as it allowed some of my humanity to come across. I am not a robot, not perfect.  It also showed how it is ok to admit shortcomings, change, and commit to doing better.  
- I asked them what times worked and did not work for them and scheduled meetings accordingly
- I opened up my calendar and began having 1-1 meetings throughout the week (yep, including Tuesdays and Thursdays).

## My current setup
As my responsibilities grew and I oversaw more departments and teams, more time was needed for both 1-1 meetings and planning.  

During this time, I would say my weeks were:
- 50% meetings (1-1s, clients, managerial, stand-ups, conferences, etc)
- 30% strategic planning (employee career growth, tech vision, company growth etc.)
- 20% R&D (including code review)

### The benefits of this new schedule
- Less back to back 1-1 meetings
- More time for 1-1 meetings (some meetings needed more time/consistently went over the time, so I scheduled accordingly)
- Reduce feelings of burnout
- More productive 1-1 meetings

## Key learnings and personal insight
- Do not overbook yourself.  You are human and need mental breaks too.
- Reflect on your calendar, is your current schedule working for you? Do you find yourself exhausted, frustrated, or dreading certain days?  Take a step back and analyze those feelings, what can you do to address this? Can you shift meetings to other days
- Avoid afternoon meetings
- Do not schedule back to back 1-1 meetings, sometimes they rollover. Also, sometimes important issues may arise towards the end of the time and you do not want to feel the pressure of the clock
- As your role changes, the way you spend your time must change as well.
- Make sure you are being present for your people.  Be your best in every 1-1 meeting you are in.  
  - to do this, make sure you are mentally rested
  - do not schedule too many 1-1 meetings in a day (my current rule is no more than three in one day)

## Conclusion
