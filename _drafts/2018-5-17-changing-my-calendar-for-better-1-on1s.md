Outline
## intro
Time management is hard. Its a skill that we will utilize in every phase of our career.  As I progressed in my career from developer, to tech lead, to VP time management has become that much more critical at each step. I wish I could tell you that it gets easier over time.  Nope, sorry.  What I can say is that experience will help you understand areas of how you manage your time that you may want to reflect on.  

One of my biggest learnings as it relates to my own time management, is to take time (ha) to reflect on how I am spending my time.  I typically try something out for specified period, be it 1 week, a quarter, or 6 months, then take a step back and reflect on what worked and what didn't. If there is one thing that has helped me improve my time management, is taking the opportunity to self reflect and and  measure my own performance.  

I did this recently to improve how I was organizing my calendar as it related to my 1-1 sessions

## My previous setup
For a period of 3-4 years, I followed a similar schedule. I split up my week with "meeting" days and "development" days.  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday were meeting days, Tuesday and Thursday (the even days) were development days (i.e. when I got "even" with code).  During this time I was directly responsible for a team between 3-7, with about 5 weekly 1-1 meetings with individual contributors.

This schedule worked for a while and had many benefits
- I knew going into each day what the general focus was
- Team members had a clear sense of what my meetings days were and we scheduled accordingly
- It gave me full days to dive right into code (hold this thought)

However, as the team grew and my responsibilities broaden

- How this setup did not scale
- my current setup
- learnings
