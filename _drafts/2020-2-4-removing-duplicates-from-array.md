## Outline
- purpose (why are we writing about this)
- ways to remove duplicates
  - brute force for loop - O(n^2);
  - solution with hash?  - is there an O(n) solution w/o using built in functions?
    - probably if you use a frequency table
  - use sets
  - use filter
  - use reduce
  - can you use map?
- conclusion
- additional resources
