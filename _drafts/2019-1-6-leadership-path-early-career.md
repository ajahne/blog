## Outline
- why am I writing this
- Discuss initial board meeting

## Why am I writing this
I am a board member the external CS advisory committee at Tufts University.  Last fall, during our inaugural meeting, we broke between sessions to have lunch with some of the students in the CS department.  The lunch was great because I got a chance to meet and speak with students.  It had been years since I had been on campus.  The department had grown, there were new extra-curricular activities (like JumboCode), and an excited student body with passionate teachers.

I smiled. It was good to be back.

I ate my sandwich (and destroyed _two_ cookies), while

Me? It brought me back.

Me? The student who got a D- in Intro to Computer Science

Me? The kid who pinky-promised with the Dean of Engineering to go to class every day.

Me? The student who got a B- in Algorithms (by far the hardest core class I took)

Me? The student who turned it around and made Dean's list in his Junior and Senior year.

Who was the TA for OOP in Java.

Who became the head TA for for intro to computer science. The same course he almost failed.

Who, on his first position was told that he would not be fit for the position.

So now I am the VP of Technology & Engineering a TrueChoice Solutions. From almost failing out, to succeeding, to excelling, teaching, and now continuing to mentor and coach engineers from entry level to architect.

Yeah...maybe I did have a few perspectives I could share.

All this jetted through my head all in the time it took me to finish that first cookie!

I shared some thoughts with the students on leadership, things that you can do while in school to prepare yourself for your career, and interspersed pieces of my journey.  I realized I had some things I could share, more than what I was able to share during our lunch. Inspired, I jotted some notes and determined I would share a few tips that would be helpful to people pursuing their degrees that can (begin to) prepare them for their professional journey.  

My thoughts, coming right up? But first...a word on our definitions.  What is Leadership...

## What is Leadership?
I like this definition from Forbes Magazine:
> Leadership is a process of social influence, which maximizes the efforts of others, towards the achievement of a goal.

The students asked me "What do I do to get on the leadership path?". The interpretation at that time, the underlying context, was how do I become a VP, a manager, a director, a CTO? Before we proceed, I want to stress that being a manager is not the only way to be a leader. Leadership is not about the amount of people you manage, but the impact you have on your team, initiative, organization, or project.

I have worked with engineers who did not manage any direct reports bought had great impact and showed leadership through problem solving, setting and sharing of standards, mentorship, and high quality development, architecture, system design.

## Leadership vs management
> Leadership is not about the amount of people you manage, but the impact you have on your team, initiative, organization, or project.

Management is not a promotion, it is a career change.  

- The only way to get ahead is not through management
- Management is a career change
- Discuss leadership vs management
- Can be a leader as an IC

## General
- leaders are readers
- study the craft
- find a mentor

## While in School (be it University, Code Academy)
### Study the craft
Fundamental to your career as a computer scientest...is..well..computer science! To that end, get good at this!  Most importantly, learn how to learn!  The core of what you learn in school (algorithms, data structures, programming principles, etc.) will buttress your career.  Addionally, what will? learning how to learn.

> Most importantly, Learn how to learn

Learning is forever.  In our industry, we are constantly learning.  Not to be overly dramatic, learn or die (ok...that was overly dramatic).

Once you leave school, the learning has essentially just begins.  On the job you will

### Be a TA or Tutor
One area that helped me early in my career (and continues to do so), was becoming a TA.  Being a TA helped me further learn the craft, understand how to teach, and most importantly grow my ability to empathize.

### Work in groups
In school, I did most of my programming alone.  In my dorm room, in the computer lab. However, in my first job at a marketing agency, I was thrust into a team, where the most important thing was not my ability to program (which, was key), but my ability to communicate and work with others. On almost all job specs, you will see some version of "strong written and verbal communication".

Yet. We. Do. All. Our. Work. ALONE.

Programming alone in a computer lab is not analogous to working in a professional environment.

So a few things to do:
- take a class (or classes) where there is an opportunity to work in groups

Yeah, Ajahne, what works...but what if that doesn't work?

Grab a friend or colleague and try out some duck typing or pair programming.  Many teams practice one or both. Take the initiative to push yourself.  Boom, leadership exhibited!

If you have worked in groups, great! Take the opportunity to organize the  

### Get an internship
- Unable to obtain an internship? Be a TA over the summer or

### Participate to Extra curricular activities and groups (learn how to work with groups/teams)
While in college, I was part of NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers), I resurrected the chapter at Tufts and led the organization locally.

There are numerous society and activities to be a part of from IEEE, NSBE, Girls who Code, etc.

Tufts has JumboCode and I am sure your school may have something analogous.  If it doesn't, find an opportunity to volunteer.

### Do something outside of programming
In college, I was a part of Onyx,a poetry and visual art magazine that published an collection of art from the student body each semester.  In addition,

I had to:
- follow up with the printer
- organize all
- review art submissions
- organize spoken-word open mics
- create (with my co-editor) the magazine each semester

This helped teach me time management,


### Bonus 1: A quick personal note, getting an advanced degree
For me personally, getting my masters degree has helped me tremendously in career. It helped set me a part from other candidates, it provided my opportunities to become the head TA for computer science, and most importantly, gave me the confidence that I could actually be a computer scientist.  All of this is a topic and post for another time.  I say this to say, is that we all learn and grow at our own pace.  Do what **you** need to get the reps in required to be the awesome programmer (and person!) you need to be

### Bonus 2: Get experience programming outside of the classroom
Programming in class is different from programming the cubicle. Take on a coding challenge

## Some additional resources:
- Pragmatic Programmer
- Work on TDD
- Improve your debugging skills

## Some additional tips
- Start a blog
- Attend meetups and build your network
- Find speaking engagements -
- Work and school at the same time (for some this is not an option) - teaches time management

## Conclusion
- Leadership is about seeing an objective that needs to be accomplished and working to ensure the collective goal is reached
