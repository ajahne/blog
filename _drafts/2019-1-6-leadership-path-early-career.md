## Why am I writing this
I am a board member the external CS advisory committee at Tufts University.  Last fall, during our inaugural meeting, we broke between sessions to have lunch with some of the students in the CS department.  The lunch was great because I got a chance to meet and speak with students.  It had been years since I had been on campus.  The department had grown, there were new extra-curricular activities (like JumboCode), and an excited student body with passionate teachers.

I smiled. It was good to be back.

I ate my sandwich (and destroyed _two_ cookies), while

Me?  It brought me back.

Me? The student who got a D- in Intro to Computer Science

Me? The kid who pinky-promised with the Dean of Engineering to go to class every day.

Me? The student who got a B- in Algorithms (by far the hardest core class I took)

Me? The student who turned it around and made Dean's list in his Junior and Senior year.

So now I am the VP of Technology & Engineering a TrueChoice Solutions. From almost failing out, to succeeding, to excelling, teaching, and now continuing to mentor and coach engineers from entry level to architect.

Yeah...maybe I did have a few perspectives I could share.

All this jetted through my head all in the time it took me to finish that first cookie!

I shared some thoughts with the students on leadership, things that you can do while in school to prepare yourself for your career, and interspersed pieces of my journey.  I realized I had some things I could share, more than what I was able to share during our lunch. Inspired, I jotted some notes and determined I would share a few tips that would be helpful to people pursuing their degrees that can (begin to) prepare them for their professional journey.  

My thoughts, coming right up? But first...a word on our definitions

## What is Leadership?
The students asked me "What do I do to get on the leadership path?". The interpretation at that time, the underlying context, was how do I become a VP, a manager, a director, a CTO? Before we proceed, I want to stress that being a manager is not the only way to be a leader. Leadership is not about the amount of people you manage, but the impact you have on your team, initiative, organization, or project.

I have worked with engineers who did not manage any direct reports bought had great impact and showed leadership through problem solving, setting and sharing of standards, mentorship, and high quality development, architecture, system design.
