Earlier this year I spent time volunteering.

Every other Wednesday for two months, I conducted two hour long interviews with candidates.

This was important to me. In the tech industry there are not many people that look like me.

So what was it like? Well my interviews started right when COVID hit. This impact? Everything was

One of the most challenges aspects of being a manager is staying technical. Frankly one of the challenges in our industry is staying technical. Frameworks, languages, APIs, libraries, and more are always evolvging.  When you are in your day to day, how do you stay up to speed?

Recently I was deep in the interview process for a new leadership opportunity. I wanted a change and a new challenge.

Interviews were conducted virtually, using Google Hangouts and code was written over repl.

I was just wrapping up my rounds of interviews with FAANGs, top tier tech companies, brand name industry leaders, and high-growth startups. I felt with the knowldge that I had just brushed up on and improved, I could offer some things.

It was important to me to volunteer and give back. I interviewed a wide array of engineers. All driven and passaionate canaidates who were driven to push themselves. Many of the people I interviewed were women and under represented minorities. Our industry not only lacks diversity, but lacks support for diverse engineers once they are in the industry.

This is something near and dear to me.

When I was in college, I was often the only Black person in my computer science classes.

I was one of two African American Students out of 100 to graduate within the school of engineering in the fields of Comptuer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering.

There was many times when I felt it just wasn't for me.

I was a junior in college before I ever had my first Black professor. My first black teacher of any kind.  Through grammar school, middle, high school, and more, I had never had a teacher that looked like me. I was always told that I could be anything, do anything. But its hard to believe in dreams when no one in them looks like you.

So yes, I remember that day in Computational Theory vividly.

I was in Halligan 101. Sitting on the right side of the class room, in the front and listening to Professor Laing break down state machines. It was a sunny spring afternoon in Medford, Massachussetts. I sat in the front, in a plastic chair with metal legs, right "desk-arm" wrapping around and holding my notebook sturdily as I scribbled down key points from the lecture.

While I do not remember my outfit. That was the baggy jean days days. The long Tee days. Tight corn-rows under the doo-rag days. And I was always dressed that way, not knowing how to let go of my hood, to let go of me. Still finding me.  Still looking for me.

The sun was peaking through the window on the right side of the classroom. My vision drifted from the whiteboard to the window and through that transparent glass I gazed. I stared through it, over the grass, beyond the parking lot, and through the field. My focus was not on what was outside of the window. I saw something else that day. I felt something.

For the first time in my entire college tenure. I felt that I could do it. That I could be a computer scientist. That I could be a software engineer.That I could excel.  That I could be...me. All of me.

I saw myself in this professor who was the first Black professor that I had ever had. He commanded the lecture hall. He was light of frame with a crisp white button down tucked neatly into khaki slacks. And while we did not dress the same or look the same. I felt he was me.

A computer science professor that had my hair, that had my skin tone, that had my features. Up until that point, I had not quite believed that I could do this.

See the D- in intro to computer science was a stumbling block.

Being the only black person in all of my classes made me question.

Never getting my code to compile made me questions.

Having the dean call me into her office made me question.

Students saying that the only reason we (Black students) were at the university was because of affirmative action turned those questions into an ocean of doubts. Everytime I struggled, every time I did not do well in class, everytime I failed a quiz or couldn't get my code to compile. Was that because it was me? Or because maybe I should not be here. Maybe I am here to fill a quota.

Maybe I am not cut out for this.

The hesitation grew. For every question in my mind, my confidence faltered just a little bit more. For every compile error. For every emacs shortcut I couln't remember. For every program that did not pass all the tests. I doubted every more.

I felt alone. I felt lost. I felt that I wasn;t wanted. That I was not supported.

Professores not making eye contact.  Students in my classes avoiding studying with me. A peer telling me they were not going to study for the upcoming midterm test, then I saw them in a large group, at the library, studying. They would'nt meet my eyes.

The secretarty at the front office who ask me "do you go to school here" when I asked for a form to join the IEEE club. She didn't hand me the form. I never joined IEE.

The professor who called me out in the middle of class and embarrassed me in front of everyone.

Seeing classmates who looked like me withdraw from a class.

Then withdraw from the major.

Then withdraw from the school.

While I withdrew into myself.

It was a lonely road.

Feeling like I had to be great, not just for me, but for an entire group of people.

See it got to the point where I was the only one left. The only Black person in my year studying computer science in the school of engineering. If I drop out...then none of us make it.

And in that day, in Halligan Hall, with the sun shining in across college ave, through the window of Halligan 101, while I listened to Professor Laing teach us about state machines, I believed for the first time, that I could be a software engineer. I believed for the first time that I could do it. I could make it.

That semester I made Dean's list. And the next. And once I graduated, I went and got my Masters degree in computer science. I

And, in one of my proudest moments, the kid who got a D- in intro to Comptuer Science, became the head TA for that very same class. When the professor was out, that kid taught the class.

That kid was proud.

Wearing a doo-rag, in his long T.
