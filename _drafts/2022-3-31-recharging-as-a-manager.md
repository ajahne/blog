# Outline
## intro
- recent chat with collegue, new manager, they are exhausted
- made me think of how I recharge throughtout my career
- note, if things are really bad (bad fit, culture, maybe management isn't for you), then make a change. Recharging will only be a temp fix and not addres the root cause. If you find that you have done some recharging and still feel the same way instantly upon returning to work/the day, then mabye a change is needed

Some general thoughts
- make the recharge sustainable. What can you bake into your day or week that will help give you the boost you need? Maybe weekly coaching, reading, going for a walk
- make sure to invest in yourself. You cannot fully inveest in others, if you are not investing in yourself first

I was inspired by a recent conversation I had at work

## First before we (re) charge, have we first charged?
- Is the sleep good? Getting that 8 hours? Eating good? Are things outside of work in a steady place?

When my daughter was first born, I wasn't getting any sleep. I recall going into a 1-1 with a direct report and the first thing she said to me was "you look tired".  I had tried to muster all the typical energy and excitment that I normally bring to 1-1s, but my report saw right through it. I really appreciate her candor. I was holding on by a thread. I realized I need to focus on me and my family first. I changed some things up, modified my calendar (started days earlier as I was already up, but ended much earlier as well), worked to get a Nanny, and luckily my wife and I got help from family.

After a first months, things got much better (also sleep training is a life-changer), and I was able to ensure I had the sleep, routine, and schedule that I needed to bring my full self to work.

Lastly, I have found that nothing is more important in reducing stress, anxiety, and improving health, like consistently getting a good night sleep.
