# Outline
## intro
- recent chat with collegue, new manager, they are exhausted
- made me think of how I recharge throughtout my career
- note, if things are really bad (bad fit, culture, maybe management isn't for you), then make a change. Recharging will only be a temp fix and not addres the root cause. If you find that you have done some recharging and still feel the same way instantly upon returning to work/the day, then mabye a change is needed

Some general thoughts
- make the recharge sustainable. What can you bake into your day or week that will help give you the boost you need? Maybe weekly coaching, reading, going for a walk
- make sure to invest in yourself. You cannot fully inveest in others, if you are not investing in yourself first

I was inspired by a recent conversation I had at work

## First before we (re) charge, have we first charged?
- Is the sleep good? Getting that 8 hours? Eating good? Are things outside of work in a steady place?

When my daughter was first born, I wasn't getting any sleep. I recall going into a 1-1 with a direct report and the first thing she said to me was "you look tired".  I had tried to muster all the typical energy and excitment that I normally bring to 1-1s, but my report saw right through it. I really appreciate her candor. I was holding on by a thread. I realized I need to focus on me and my family first. I changed some things up, modified my calendar (started days earlier as I was already up, but ended much earlier as well), worked to get a Nanny, and luckily my wife and I got help from family.

After a first months, things got much better (also sleep training is a life-changer), and I was able to ensure I had the sleep, routine, and schedule that I needed to bring my full self to work.

Lastly, I have found that nothing is more important in reducing stress, anxiety, and improving health, like consistently getting a good night sleep.

## Ways to recharge
### Do something you love...just for you
I love Fantasy and Sci-fi books. Recently I have made it a habit of reading for 20-30 minutes a day, something that is pure pleasure. I find this to be a moment of bliss and something that I look forward to each day.  What is something you can do each day that brings you joy?


### Go for a walk
Back before COVID, when I commutted to the the office each day, I would carve out time in the afternoons to go for a walk. My office used to be located in midtown east. I had an amazing walk route that would take me across the FDR and along the east river. I would take this walk sometimes before a big presentation, or after a difficult converastion, or just to clear my head. This was a mid-day recharge.

While I no longer communite into the office every day, I have taken up a morning walk. I can feel the difference emotional and physically between The days where I start my morning with a walk vs the days that I do not get a walk in. Walks are a way that wher I find both a chance to clear my head and also get in a few steps.   

### Meditate
A previous manager I had swore by meditaion. They used an app daily to reduce stress and center themselves. I have recently tried this out intermittendely to great results.

Balance App

Do I have more here? If not...maybe remove

### Exercise
Execersing is my personal super-charge. When I go days without exercising I get grumpy, I am slugging, and I feel less confidence in myself.



- Recharge (e.g. DBX 6 week thing)
- PTO / Vacation (assuming this covers take a day off or something different?)
- Volunteer
