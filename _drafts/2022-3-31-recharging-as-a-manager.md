# Outline
## intro
- recent chat with collegue, new manager, they are exhausted
- made me think of how I recharge throughtout my career
- note, if things are really bad (bad fit, culture, maybe management isn't for you), then make a change. Recharging will only be a temp fix and not addres the root cause. If you find that you have done some recharging and still feel the same way instantly upon returning to work/the day, then mabye a change is needed

Some general thoughts
- make the recharge sustainable. What can you bake into your day or week that will help give you the boost you need? Maybe weekly coaching, reading, going for a walk
- make sure to invest in yourself. You cannot fully inveest in others, if you are not investing in yourself first

I was inspired by a recent conversation I had at work

## First before we (re) charge, have we first charged?
- Is the sleep good? Getting that 8 hours? Eating good? Are things outside of work in a steady place?

When my daughter was first born, I wasn't getting any sleep. I recall going into a 1-1 with a direct report and the first thing she said to me was "you look tired".  I had tried to muster all the typical energy and excitment that I normally bring to 1-1s, but my report saw right through it. I really appreciate her candor. I was holding on by a thread. I realized I need to focus on me and my family first. I changed some things up, modified my calendar (started days earlier as I was already up, but ended much earlier as well), worked to get a Nanny, and luckily my wife and I got help from family.

After a first months, things got much better (also sleep training is a life-changer), and I was able to ensure I had the sleep, routine, and schedule that I needed to bring my full self to work.

Lastly, I have found that nothing is more important in reducing stress, anxiety, and improving health, like consistently getting a good night sleep.

## Ways to recharge
### Do something you love...just for you
I love Fantasy and Sci-fi books. Recently I have made it a habit of reading for 20-30 minutes a day, something that is pure pleasure. I find this to be a moment of bliss and something that I look forward to each day.  What is something you can do each day that brings you joy?


### Go for a walk
Back before COVID, when I commutted to the the office each day, I would carve out time in the afternoons to go for a walk. My office used to be located in midtown east. I had an amazing walk route that would take me across the FDR and along the east river. I would take this walk sometimes before a big presentation, or after a difficult converastion, or just to clear my head. This was a mid-day recharge.

While I no longer communite into the office every day, I have taken up a morning walk. I can feel the difference emotional and physically between The days where I start my morning with a walk vs the days that I do not get a walk in. Walks are a way that wher I find both a chance to clear my head and also get in a few steps.   

### Meditate
A previous manager I had swore by meditaion. They used an app daily to reduce stress and center themselves. I have recently tried this out intermittendely to great results.

Recently, I've used the Calm app and have begun to find benefit here to help me sleep or just give me a quick mental break in the middle of the day.

Don't want to do the app thing? No worries. Have 10 minutes and a quiet room to be still in? That works as well. Sometimes, in the middle of the day after a wall of meetings and whirlwind of work, I step away from the laptop, lay down with a warm compress over my eyes, liten to [green noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9yhdPuP8QE), and take a few minutes for myself. These are defnitenly some benefits of Virtual First.  

### Exercise
Execersing is my personal super-charger. When I go days without exercising I get grumpy, I am slogging, and I feel less confidence in myself. Carving out time to exercise can be tough when you have a busy job, family, and all those general adult responsibilities. What I have found works for me is to wake up just a little bit earlier (whcih is so hard for me as a night owl) and get in a quick bit of exercise of, sometimes 10-20 minutes (max 30). For me I have tried used fitnessblender and 12 minute athlete.  

### Volunteer
Wait, so on my "days off" you want me to do more work, Ajahne? Whoa, not saying that, but rather, spending time doing something completely different or tangential from your main career can be energizing. Previously, I have volunteered to do mock interviews or mentor aspiring engineers from non-traditional tech backgrounds.

### Take time off (recharge)
Finally, the vacation?

Wait, why did it take you so long to get here, Ajahne?

I figured I could _start_ off this post with vacations and time off, but in my experience, taking a vacation, while good in the moment, I almost always feel overwhelmed the first week I am back. If there is not a consistent method and support system to recharge your battery, you will quickly run out of gas. So yes, we all need time way, and I love vacations! It's also important to have a sunstainable injection of charge so your battery is not constantly running on 3% - waiting for the big jolt of a vaction.

One thing to do is look into what perks your company has that can help you revitalize. For example,  [Dropbox has](https://jobs.dropbox.com/Benefits#:~:text=Our%20essential%20U.S.%20benefits%20include,options%20offered%20through%20Modern%20Health.) a recharge program, monthly company wide PTO days (I'm writing this post of one of them, lol), and flexible PTO. Use your company benefits, you have earned them!
