## Intro
> One of our most important goals as leader is to create a culture of feedback

We want to grow as managers, leaders, and as people.  We cannot do this without guidance.  We cannot do this without criticism.  To be our best, we must obtain feedback from our teams.

Do not start by _giving_ feedback, instead we must start by _getting_ feedback. This will give people the confidence and comfort to have open conversations.  We, as leaders, must exemplify the behavior we want to see, further enabling and promoting it in our teams.

To encourage a culture of feedback, as leaders, we must first prove we can take it.  Don't start by dishing it out, nah, start by asking for it.  Then, when you get it be sure to:
- take action to address the feedback _(work to improve, have follow ups, etc.)_
- thank the person for their feedback _(this is important, let people know you appreciate their feedback and more will come!)_
- provide an open, and safe space for feedback.  

> prove you can take it before you dish it out

Now as managers, the one-on-one meetings is an ideal opportunity to get feedback. It is our secret weapon, one of the best tools we have in our managerial utility belt!

Start small and be consistent.  At the end of every one-on-one meeting, I ask "what feedback do you have for me"? In the first few months, there was nothing. However, I was consistent and continued to ask. Continually nudging people to give me feedback, asking for it directly and eventually, it began to flow naturally.

**Once my team knew that I wanted, encouraged, and appreciated their feedback, it came more often, more easily.** At times, feedback didn't even "wait" until one-on-ones - I received quick feedback via Slack, some thoughts right after our standing meetings, or a quick bullet in the hallway.  Now we were getting somewhere!

So what some questions you can ask to get feedback as a manager and help create a culture of feedback? Glad you asked...

## Questions
Here are some questions that I have used to obtain feedback from my team. I typically ask these at the end of one-on-one and skip-level meetings. For each of these questions, be sure to say it in your own words.  Make sure if rolls off your tongue in a natural way that works for you.

With that said, wording matters!  Do not dodge feedback by asking "*Do you* have any feedback for me".  Nah. That allows someone to opt-out, most people want to avoid uncomfortable situations. So instead, ask flat out: "*What feedback* do you have for me?".  Lean into the feedback, shift left on the feedback, [latest saying] to the feedback!

> Ask the question, then wait. Do not interrupt, do not follow up with another question. Sit with the discomfort and let

- What feedback do you have for me?
- What advice do you have for me? _(a slight change from above...but it may open up more feedback)_
- What can I do more or less of to better support you?
- What can I do more or less of to make it easier to work with me?
- What is something that we, as a team/company, are doing well that we should keep doing?
- What is something that we are doing that we should stop doing?
- What is something we are not doing that we should start doing?
- What have I done to stress you out/frustrate you?
- Would you like more or less direction from me?
- I am working on my attention to detail/listening/area I am not strong at, could you give me some feedback on how I have been doing in this area in the last week/month/quarter?
- Would you like more or less feedback on your work? If so, what additional feedback would you like?

## Conclusion
Getting feedback is critical component to our growth as managers. Ultimately, we want to foster open, collaborate, safe, and supportive environments for our team. We want to improve, get better, and create high-functioning teams.  To do that, we must start with ourselves.  Learning our blind spots, our strengths, and our areas of improvement is fundamental to being the best leaders - and people - we can be.  Is it easy? Nah. Is it worth it? No doubt.

Keep pushing, keep growing, and keep learning.  You got this!
