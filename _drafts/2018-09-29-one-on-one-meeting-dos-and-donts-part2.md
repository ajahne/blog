*As members my team grow into [tech leads]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-2-11-what-is-a-tech-lead %}) and managers I have begun to reflect on one-on-ones in an effort to help guide new managers and also to self-assess and improve the meetings I have.*

*In this two part series I will outline 10 Dos and Don'ts (five each) for one-on-one meetings based on my experience as an engineering manager and leader.*

Early on in my career I did not even know that I was supposed to have one-on-one meetings, let alone how to conduct them.  I was thrust into the role of tech lead. As with most new managers, I was not provided any training nor a clear set of expectations for my role. Up $%!# creak; no paddle.

During my first few years as a manager, I did many things right (_I hope_ :P) and many things wrong (_I know_) in my one-on-one meetings. In [Part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-16-one-on-one-meeting-dos-and-donts-part1 %}) of this series I outlined five things not to do in our one-on-one meetings. In Part 2, I will discuss five things we should do.

Let's grow!

## Five one-on-one meetings Dos:
- [Do have them](#do-have-them)
- [Do switch them up](#do-switch-them-up)
- [Do focus on the moment and be present](#do-focus-on-the-moment-and-be-present)
- [Do take notes](#do-take-notes)
- [Do come prepared](#do-come-prepared)

## Do have them
First and foremost, if you are not having one-on-one meetings, start having them! Have them and have them weekly. If you are not having 1-1, then you should. From my perspective, 1-1s are important for many reasons, including...
- They help build a rapport between you and your direct reports.  The most important aspect of any business is the people and having productive meetings with your greatest asset will help you better understand who you are working with, how to motivate, how to avoid demotivating
- Provide insight into the employee's current level of morale, stress, frustration, excitement, etc.
- These meetings can shed light on areas where the business is doing well and where it can improve - be it at the individual, team, or organizational level
- Understand more about the person you are working with to better ensure their career goals and business objectives align
- They can shed light on what motivates and excites your direct reports
- Bring frustrations to light that can be addressed, resolved, and minimized to help facilitate a high functioning team and safe environment
- Stay on target with current Performance and Development goals - be it quarterly, yearly, or another specific time frame
- Provide coaching
- Share formal and informal feedback
- Conduct them in private

So now that you're having them, great. In order to get the most out if meeting, ensuring
Switch them up

## Do switch them up
It is important to not let 1-1 meetings become monotonous.  Grab a coffee, go for a walk, switch up the location of the meeting - all of these will help keep the discussion and atmosphere fresh.  

Some suggestions include:
- taking your direct report out to lunch
- have your 1-1 in a coffee shop (and offer to buy the coffee/tea/juice)
- have a catchup over breakfast
- leave the office and talk a walk
- sit outside in a public space (park, atrium, etc.)

If the meetings are "boring" or not productive, I'm sorry (not sorry) to tell you, but on managers, that's on us.  Bad 1-1s are the fault of manager, not the managee.  Here are some additional questions you can ask to spice things up.  Below you will find some recipes to switch up the formula.

## Do focus on the moment and be present
> Ask you colleague what is a time that works for them

We have all been in meetings that we may not have wanted to be in. Sometimes we are tired, not feeling well, maybe there are pressing matters outside of work that are on your mind. We may gaze.  As leaders,

One way that I improved my ability to focus and "be present" was to give myself breaks in between meetings and to remind myself "it is not about me". Leadership can be challenging as we are always "on", pulled in many different directions, and balancing multiple balls in the air at all times.  Be sure to take care of yourself, sleep well, eat well, and exercise.  

Finally, work to schedule 1-1s at a time that works for both parties. Are you a morning person? Does your direct report have a packed Thursday? Are Mondays the company meeting and planning day, so having a one-on-one on this day my be overwhelming?  Ask your colleague what works for them and schedule meetings accordingly.

Originally I tried to have "meeting days" and "development days". This didn't scale as the size of the team grew. Instead I have spread my meetings across all days throughout the week. As my team and I prefer morning meetings - in order to not break up the day -

## Do take notes
I have a folder for each employee and a notebook specifically dedicated to one-on-one meetings.  

I keep track of what was discussed, including:
- what was on my direct report's agenda
- areas of excitement, frustrations, etc.
- feedback from my direct report to me and from me to my direct report
- follow ups, to-dos, and any next steps

The notes are helpful in:
- keeping track of progress made
- documenting follow ups and next steps

If it works for you, definitely share the notes. Some team members want to see the notes I have written down others keep their own.

## Do come prepared
Have an agenda
- in my experience it is best

- [Here is an article](https://blog.knowyourcompany.com/7-ways-to-prepare-to-have-an-effective-one-on-one-meeting-with-your-manager-3b7e083cb3bb) you can share with your team that will help them come more prepared to one-on-one meetings

## Do ask for (and provide) feedback:
I end each one-on-one by asking if they have any feedback for me? And most times the answer is "No, Ajahne. I do not have any feedback". But I continue to ask this question to let people know that I value feedback
