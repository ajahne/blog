## Dos:
- do have them

## Background
First and foremost, if you are not having 1-1 meetings, start having them! Have them, have them weekly. If you are not having 1-1, then you should. From my perspective, 1-1s are critical because...
- They help build a rapport between you and your direct reports.  The most important aspect of any business is the people and having productive meetings with your greatest asset will help you better understand who you are working with, how to motivate, how to avoid demotivating
- Provide insight into the employee's current level of morale, stress, frustration, excitement, etc.
- These meetings can shed light on areas where the business is doing well and where it can improve - be it at the individual, team, or organizational level
- Understand more about the person you are working with to better ensure their career goals and business objectives align
- They can shed light on what motivates and excites your direct reports
- Bring frustrations to light that can be addressed, resolved, and minimized to help facilitate a high functioning team and safe environment
- Stay on target with current Performance and Development goals - be it quarterly, yearly, or another specific time frame
- Provide coaching
- Share formal and informal feedback

## do switch them up
It is important to not let 1-1 meetings become monotonous.  Grab a coffee, go for a walk, switch up the location of the meeting - all of these will help keep the discussion and atmosphere fresh.  

Some suggestions include:
- taking your direct report out to lunch
- have your 1-1 in a coffee shop (and offer to buy the coffee/tea/juice)
- have a catchup over breakfast
- leave the office and talk a walk
- sit outside in a public space (park, atrium, etc.)


- do focus on the moment and be present
- do take notes
- do come prepared

## Other:
- do not undervalue them
- do not let them get stuck in a rut
- do not think having 1-1s is a panacea
- do not avoid the hard conversations
- do reflect on them
- do ask for feedback

Conduct them in private
- so now you're having them, great. In order to get the most out if meeting, ensuring
Switch them up

Take notes

Be present
We have all been in meetings that we may not have wanted to be in. Sometimes we are tired, not feeling well, maybe there are pressing matters outside of work that are on your mind. We may gaze

Worked to schedule 1-1s at a time that works for both parties. Are you a morning person? Does your direct report have a packed Thursday?

Originally I tried to have "meeting days" and "development days". This didn't scale as the size of the team grew. Instead I have spread my meetings across all days throughout the work. As my team and I prefer morning meetings,

Write about meetings
Write about my schedule

Have an agenda
- in my experience it is best

If the meetings are "boring" or not productive, I'm sorry to tell you, but that's on you.  Bad 1-1s are the fault of manager, not the direct report.  Here are some additional questions you can ask to spice things up.  Below you will find some recipes to switch up the formula.


Early on in my career I did not even know that I was supposed to have one-on-one meetings, let alone how to conduct them.  I was thrust into the role of tech lead. As with most new managers, I was not provided any training nor a clear set of expectations for my role. Up $%!# creak; no paddle.
