# Staying Technical as a Manager
As an engineering manager, one of the biggest challenges is to find the balance between being a great mentor, leader, and coach while staying on top of the constant changes in technology.  As an engineering leader we must be able to communicate with executives, meet with clients, set the technology roadmap and vision, motivate our teams, while in parallel keep our technical skills sharp.

So, maybe you are a tech lead responsible for a project and working with peers to meet a collective goal. Maybe you are an engineering manager or director leading a team of senior engineers and building out critical features on the product roadmap.  Or maybe you are the VP of engineering responsible for overseeing all technology teams plus collaborating with peers across departments. 

As an engineering manager, you are expected to conduct 1-1 meetings, write brilliant emails that summarize a whirlwind of topics into concise bullets, work with executives, manage vendors, and so much more. You love every minute (hopefully). And yet...how do you find time to stay on top of technology trends?

Whelp, no one said it was going to be easy! But where is the fun in easy...

Here are some ideas that I follow, which I hope you find helpful as well.

## Read a great programming book
Leaders are readers!  Have an hour long commute? Maybe spend a few minutes reading a book on programming, leadership, algorithms, new language features, or clean code.
Some suggestions:
- clean code and/or clean architecture
- pragmatic programmer
- gang of four
- automate the boring stuff
- The "You Don't Know JS" Series
- Books by Zakas

This is just start, this section (and many of the others) could be there own post! 

## Sign up for a newsletter (or three)

## Attend Meetups
OK, let's jump off the phone/tablet/PC and get some fresh air and fresh perspectives.
- React
- Angular
- Cloud

## Stay in the code
Fix a bug, edit a (small) feature, build to production. See what the dev environment is like. Make sure you can build the system that the team you lead/collaborate with is responsible for maintaining.

## Code what you love
Love AR? Do it!  Inspired by the latest SRE tech? Go work in it! Follow your passions and dive into what inspires you.

## Write a blog :)
I encourage you to push yourself. Want to get better at that cool tech you keep reading about? Code up a few "hello worlds" on GitHub and write about it.  Tried out some great new tools at work?  Blog about it. There will be someone who will appreciate it and to top it off, you will be giving back to the community that has given so much to us.

# Conclusion
Let me know if you have any further suggestions!
