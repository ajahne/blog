# Staying Technical as a Manager
As an engineering manager, one of the most challenging tasks is to find balance being a great mentor, leader, and coach while staying on top of the constant changes in technology.  As an engineering leader we must be able to communicate with executives, meet with clients, set the technology roadmap and vision, motivate our teams, while also keep our skills sharp as an engineer.

Whelp, noone said it was going to be easy!

So, maybe you are a tech lead and are responsible for a project and working with peers to meet a collective goal. Maybe you are an engineering manager or director leading a team of senior engineerings and building out the product roadmap.  Or maybe you are the VP of engineering responsible for overseeing all technology teams plus working with peers in other departments.

As an engineering manager, you are expected to conduct 1-1 meetings, write brilliant emails that summarize a whirlwind of topics into concise bullets, working with executives, manage vendors, and so much more. You love every minute (hopefully). And yet...how do you find time to stay on top of technology trends?

Here are some ideas that I follow, which I hope you find helpful as well

## Read a great programming book
Leaders are readers!  Have an hour long commute? Maybe spend a few minutes reading a book on programming, leadership, algorithms, new language features, or clean code.
Some suggestions:
- clean code
- pragmatic programmer

I will share more in an additional post.

## Stay in the code
Fix a bug, edit a (small) feature, build to production. See what the dev environment is like. Make sure you can build the system that the team you lead is responsible for maintaining.

## Code what you love
Love AR? Do it!  Inspired by the latest SRE tech? Go work in it!  Follow you passions and dive into what inspires you.

## Write a blog :)
I encourage you to push yourself. Want to get better at that cool tech you keep reading about? Code up a few "hello worlds" on github and write about it.  Tried out some great new tech at work?  Blog about it. There will be someone who will appreciate it and you will be giving back to the community that has given so much to us.
