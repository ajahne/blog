### How to make staff augmenter/partner work
- communication what’s the person working on? Skills required?
- “Over-communicate"
- Have stability in your organization
- Have the team visit your office
- Have you visit them, - visit with the people
- Understand the culture of the company
- Have a clear objective, ask yourself: Why am I outsourcing? What needs to get done?
- Does the firm understand your needs fully and are they asking the right questions of you / your team so that in their evaluation / sourcing process; are they presenting the best possible candidates to you.
- Will the developers selected be 100% dedicated to you and your team for the project’s duration?
- Get it written into your contract that you can bail after a specified period of time (e.g. 1 week, 2 weeks), allow for a trial period
- Conduct real site visits to have teams meet in person

### How to evaluate a partner
- communication
- Do they speak the language
- Do you share a similar time zone and or is partner willing to extend hours to work with you?
- Be clear on your budget
- Who is involved? What are the escalation points?
- Hands on or hands off
- What is the team composition
- What is the management structure? (Both your team and the partner)
- Take time to interview the developers and people you will work with (a point heavily stressed by Dmitry as well)
  - Furthermore, talk to delivery team, the tech team, understand who you will work with?
- conduct normal technical and personal interview as you would conduct for any in-house developer
- Talk with the person that owns the consulting company (or as close to that person as you can get).
  - You want to know how that person will handle any issues you present to them. Is it easy or difficult to get them to give you 30 minutes of their time now? Do you feel they are direct, honest, and have integrity?
- Ask disconfirming questions of the developers and the consulting company including: Are there any technologies you don't like working with? Are there any bug tracking tools or processes you shy away from and why? Tell me about a client engagement that failed and why did it fail?
- Speak with references, other clients who have challenges similar to yours who have used their services. Ask the references "What did XYZ Co. do well?" "What do you wish they did differently?"
- See if company will run a trial period

### Questions to ask yourself
- Determine if you want to just have a transactional or long term business relationship with the provider.
- If its transactional then you will need a constant filtering/QA-QC/validation of the talent, terms, project work product to make sure you manage the risk profile of your engagement and that you have heavy checkpoints at least 1-2x a week for the duration of the engagement.
- What is the time horizon? Long term? Short term?
- How clear is your scope? How subject to change is it?
- How complex is the project?
  - if you're dealing with high complexity and/or low clarity/lots of change, consider on-site consultants vs remote.
