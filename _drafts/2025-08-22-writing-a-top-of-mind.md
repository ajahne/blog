Outline
- What is a top of mind?
  - a communication to your team and peers on a frequent cadence to give udates on what you have been working on, what are the top priorities, etc. 
- Why write it?
  - communication (share top down information)
  - help align top level strategy with "on the ground" work
  - help group / people understand you and your role (e.g. what does an engineering group lead actually do?)
  - connect on a human level - one thing I love to do is share a personal bit about me, helps humanimze me as a leader, manager, etc.
  - scale yourself - no matter how mnay 1-1s conversations you have, you will be unable to meet with everyone in a timely manner to get message across
