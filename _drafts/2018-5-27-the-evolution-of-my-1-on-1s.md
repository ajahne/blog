As memory serves, early in my career I was never technically "promoted" to a manager.  Instead, there was an intern whose boss left that company I worked at and it was assumed, in his absence, that the intern was now my responsibility. I didn't have an official manager (oh I had a boss and people telling me what to work on) so I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do.  Looking back I failed, stumbled, and succeeded - there were times, I tell ya - through luck, charisma, perseverance and hard work. There were many things I learned over the years as the team grew from how to listen, to lead, to coach, to create and share a vision, to motivate, step aside, delegate, and more.  However, if there was one thing I could go back and tell myself (besides to read _a lot_ more) is to **have weekly one on one (1-1) meetings with my direct reports**.  

Early on in my career I didn't conduct them, frankly I didn't even know I was supposed to conduct them.  I didn't even know what they were, how to have they, or why they were (are) important.  My manager never had them with me and so, welp, I modeled (incorrectly) much of my early management behavior off what I experienced in my own career.  

If your experience is anything like mine you were a (highly?) productive individual contributor that promoted to management. Maybe you have someone guiding you (career coach, mentors, a great manager) and if you do, congrats, you are probably one of the few.  If not and you are thrust intro management by circumstance or by choice (it should be by choice).  In either cases, I hope my story will help your journey. The lumps and the learnings, the stumbles and the success.

In an effort to share my experiences to both help those who are having similar experiences and to let you know that there are others who have similar experiences, here is the evolution of my 1-1s. It starts with the Dark Ages...

## TL;DR
Over the course of my career my interactions with my direct reports has evolved significantly.  I went from not having 1-1s at all to having productive weekly 1-1s and have seen how these meetings can help employees and the overall organizations health.  

So Why have 1-1 meetings? These meeting ensure managers and their direct reports stay on the same page.  They help build a rapport, develop a strong relationship, help employees stay engaged, and help team members feel that they are supported and are working towards their goals.  


## The Dark Ages
A warm spring wind blows through the bustling corridors of the newly built castle as a wide eyed squire is freshly knighted in the courtyard.  The angelic songs of the cherumbins float glorisuly as a feast unlike any other is shared by princesss and prince a like. He arises, a hero sworn, ready for his destiny to lead a team of noble warriors to protect the great treasure and...

Wait, listen, none of that happened.  There was no pomp, no circumstance, and not even a meeting amongst leadership.  I was working at a small startup (less than eight people at the time). So, there was me programmer one day, "manager" the next. Frankly I was not even told I was a manager, there was no title change (no salary change), but there was definitely a change in expectations. I now had an intern who "reported" to me. Oh, great...so now what?  What should I do?

Shortly thereafter we grew as an organization and hired two more members of the burgeoning "Frontend" team.  During this time we hired a strong team and I look back at the success of this time and put the full congratulations on the team for being excellent. They worked hard, hit deadlines, innovated

During this time I was learning to [let go]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-3-1-letting-go %}), how to delegate, how to listen, how to balance my work and the work of my direct reports.  While I was not aware of the concept then, I can safely say during this time I was a [Tech Lead]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-2-11-what-is-a-tech-lead %}).

At a startup, we are often reactive to the next request, putting out fires, and wearing multiple hats.  I did not

Outline
- first time as a manager
- had no idea about

What I did well
- staying afloat
- maintaing a cohesive team through the early phase of a small company/startup.
Where I struggled
- As I did not have reoccurring meetings with people, I had no idea how things were going? Were they happy?  Did they feel they were progressing as a team?
What I learned

## The Renaissance

## The Modern Age

## Forward towards the future

## A note on the frequency of 1-1s

## Conclusion
- have 1-1s
- have them frequently (weekly to bi-weekly)
- take notes
- reflect on 1-1s (always work to make them better and more productive)
- be present
- have an agenda
- Do not cancel them
- Switch it up (change location, have free flowing conversations)
