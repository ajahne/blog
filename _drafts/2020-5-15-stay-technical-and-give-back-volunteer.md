## Outline for post
- Why it‚Äôs important to stay technical
- Why it‚Äôs important to give back
- How I got involved
- What I did to prepare
- How the interview process went

Earlier this year I spent time volunteering.

Every other Wednesday for two months, I conducted two hour long interviews with candidates.

This was important to me. In the tech industry there are not many people that look like me and I feel it is important to give back.

Furthermore, one of the most challenging aspects of being a manager is staying technical. Frankly one of the challenges in our industry in general is staying technical. Frameworks, languages, APIs, libraries, and more are always evolving.  When you are in your day to day, how do you stay up to speed?

Recently I was deep in the interview process for a new leadership opportunity. I wanted a change and a new challenge.

I was just wrapping up my rounds of interviews with FAANGs, top tier tech companies, brand name industry leaders, and high-growth startups. I felt with the knowledge that I had just brushed up on and improved, I could offer some things.

It was important to me to volunteer and give back. I interviewed a wide array of engineers. All driven and passionate candidates who were driven to push themselves. Many of the people I interviewed were women and under represented minorities. Our industry not only lacks diversity, but lacks support for diverse engineers once they are in the industry.

So what was it like? Well my interviews started right when COVID hit. This impact? Everything was done remotely. Interviews were conducted virtually, using Google Hangouts and code was written over repl.

## 1: Why it‚Äôs important to stay technical
- Our industry changes so rapidly, learn or die. Not physically, but career-wise. If you do not evolve, your career progression will stagnant.
- What you do at work will not necessarily align  with the current trends and ways if the industry. Many moons ago I worked on Adobe Flash (ADD LINK HERE) when it was dying. Recently I was deep into Angular when React was eating the world. Even in my most recent interviews with JavaScript as my strongest language I needed to take time to brush up on data structures and algorithms.
- So staying technical is critical. As a manager? Even more so as our days are not spent coding or designing or architecting. But rather coaching, executing, building teams, and setting direction.
- As I was deep in my interviewing processes for FAANGs, etc, technology is key ‚Äúgive quote from green book‚Äù
- I was rusty before my deep studying and saw this as an opportunity to keep the learning going

## 2: Why it‚Äôs important to give back
- To get to where I am I have stood on the shoulders of giants (LINK TO REP POST), had the support of family, armies of friends, professors, loved ones, coworkers and mentors of all flavors. I would not be here without the support of others. I feel indebted and try as I can to pay it forward (as well as back) as often as I can. I mentor, I support the BSCS at Tufts, board member (LINK), and one of the core reasons I write this blog is to share the knowledge I have learned through your my career. Hoping this small gesture can pay back even some of the help you have gotten
- Representation maters (LINK). Seeing Pursuit's mission and groove bing in their goals to help people find careers in this tech industry that under represents the world as it looks.
- Throughout the interviews I met numerous underrepresented minorities and women in tech who were technically proficient, driven, hard working, and passionate about growing as software engineers.
- I hope by seeing someone who looks like them that I was able to inspire even the smallest bit inspiration, then I have done even more than I could have hoped for. Humbled I would be.

## 3: How I got involved as a volunteer for Pursuit
- I met Alexis (LINK to bio / linkedin), the head of volunteering, at a networking event for engineering leaders in NYC. A pursuit fellow gave a presentation on their work, what they learned, and the impact it had. I was hooked
- I signed my name up as a volunteer and started from there
- A few months later we figure out a tome and what would aligned best with my skills. I decided to support them in their technical interview process.
- Looking to volunteer, reach out (LIJNK)
- At the time I was deep in my own interview process. Interviewing for leadership positions at FAANGs, tier 1 tech companies, and growth stage startups.  I figured that helping out with interviews would both keep me sharp and help support fellows who were looking to break into the industry

## 4: What I did to prepare
For preparation, pursuit provide the volunteers with an overview of the program and a walkthrough of the interview process. There was a list of technical questions prepared by the pursuit teams for us to take. Questions like this one and this one (nah, these ain‚Äôt the real questions, I ain‚Äôt giving you those. I have been sworn to secrecy)

To make sure I was on point, I wrote up answers to each of the questions in JavaScript, giving myself the same amount of time as the candidates. Wanted to test myself :). Furthermore, I made sure I was familiar with each answer as well as the time and space complexity of optimal solutions.

The great part is that the fellows take programs in either JavaScript or Swift. So some of the candidates posted their answers in Swift which I am not familiar with. I took this as an opportunity to brush up on Swift fundamentals. While I am no Swift expert, I can definitely knock out a "Hello World" or two and a few low level programming interview questions :)

As I was studying for interviews during this time I was already familiar with this process. However as we were using Repl instead of white boards I want to make sure all of my code ran and compiled. Not time to write unit tests, but I did think about how I would test my solutions

We were given a GitHub and I checked the solutions against that. I then checked the questions that would be asked and made sure I was comfortable with each way to tackle it.

## 5: How the interview process went
- TBD
- Each week I was set up with 2 candidates to interview. Each one was an hour each. We spent a few minutes
- We used Google Hangouts and Repl.
- I interviewed the candidates, asking a technical question and we used Repl as our "white board". I offered hints where appropriate and took notes on how they approach the problem, asked clarigying questions, and ultimately if they were able to solve the problem. There were guidlines provided by Pursuit on how to provide hints and what to look for, so I was all set there üòÄ.
- At the end of each interview I submitted my notes into a form and checked in with the volunteer lead.
- What I enjoyed most about the interview process was meeting the fellows. Each one had a story, a reason for pursuing their passions. It was insightful to see how they approached each problem. As I was actively interviewing myself I could give pointers (after the interview was completed) and also reflect on where I could improve when I was in similar interview situations in the future.
