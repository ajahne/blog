Earlier this year, on every other Wednesday for two months, I volunteered at [Pursuit](https://www.pursuit.org) to conduct technical interviews for engineering fellows.

This was important to me for many reasons. In the tech industry there are not many people that look like me and I feel it is important to give back.

Furthermore, one of the most challenging aspects of being a manager is staying technical.  Frameworks, languages, APIs, libraries, and more are always evolving.  When you are in your day to day, how do you stay up to speed?

Well let's talk a bit about staying technical while also giving back:
- Why itâ€™s important to stay technical
- Why itâ€™s important to give back
- How I got involved
- What I did to prepare
- How the interview process went
- Conclusion

## 1: Why itâ€™s important to stay technical
Our industry changes so rapidly, learn or die. Not physically, but career-wise. If you do not evolve, your career progression will stagnant.

What you do at work will not necessarily align  with the current trends and ways of the industry. Many moons ago I worked on Adobe Flash (ADD LINK HERE) when it was dying. Recently I was deep into Angular when React was eating the world. Even in my most recent interviews with JavaScript as my strongest language I needed to take time to brush up on data structures and algorithms.

So staying technical is critical. As a manager? Even more so as our days are not spent coding or designing or architecting. But rather coaching, executing, building teams, and setting direction.

Recently I was deep in the interview process with FAANGs, top tier tech companies, and high-growth startups. Through volunteering, I saw an opportunity to keep the learning going while also giving back!

## 2: Why itâ€™s important to give back
To get to where I am I have stood on the shoulders of giants (LINK TO REP POST), had the support of family, armies of friends, professors, loved ones, coworkers and mentors of all flavors. I would not be here without the support of others. I feel indebted and try as I can to pay it forward (as well as back) as often as I can.

And let's keep it real, representation maters (LINK). Seeing Pursuit's mission and groove bing in their goals to help people find careers in this tech industry that under represents the world as it looks.

Throughout the interviews I met numerous underrepresented minorities and women in tech who were technically proficient, driven, hard working, and passionate about growing as software engineers. I hope by seeing someone who looks like them that I was able to inspire even the smallest bit inspiration, then I have done even more than I could have hoped for. Humbled I would be.

## 3: How I got involved as a volunteer for Pursuit
I met Alexis (LINK to bio / linkedin), the head of volunteering, at a networking event for engineering leaders in NYC. A pursuit fellow gave a presentation on their work, what they learned, and the impact it had. I was hooked.

I signed my name up as a volunteer and started from there. A few months later we figured out a time and what volunteer opportunities would best align with my skills. I decided to support them in their technical interview process. Looking to volunteer, reach out (LINK)

## 4: What I did to prepare
For preparation, Pursuit provides the volunteers with an overview and a walkthrough of the interview process. There was a list of technical questions prepared by the Pursuit team for us to choose from. Questions like this one and this one _(nah, these ainâ€™t the real questions, I ainâ€™t giving you those. I have been sworn to secrecy)_.

To make sure I was on point, I wrote up answers to each of the questions in JavaScript, giving myself the same amount of time as the candidates. Furthermore, I made sure I was familiar with each answer as well as the time and space complexity of optimal solutions.

The great part is that the fellows take programs in either JavaScript or Swift. So some of the candidates presented their answers in Swift which I am not familiar with. I took this as an opportunity to brush up on Swift fundamentals. While I am no Swift expert, I can definitely knock out a "Hello World" or two and answer low level programming interview questions :).

As I was studying for interviews during this time I was already familiar with this process. However as we were using Repl (LINK) instead of white boards I wanted to make sure all of my code ran and compiled. No time to write unit tests, but I did think about how I would test my solutions.

## 5: How the interview process went
Each week I was set up with two candidates to interview over Google Hangout. Each interview was an hour each. We spent a few minutes saying hello and then jumped right into it.

I interviewed the candidates, asking a technical question and we used Repl  as our "white board". I offered hints where appropriate, took notes on how they approached the problem, asked clarifying questions, and ultimately determined if they were able to solve the problem. There were guidelines provided by Pursuit on how to provide hints and what to look for, so I was all set there ðŸ˜€.

At the end of each interview I submitted my notes into a form and checked in with the volunteer lead.

**What I enjoyed most about the interview process was meeting the fellows. Each one had a story, a reason for pursuing their passions**. It was insightful to see how they approached each problem. As I was actively interviewing myself I could give pointers _(after the interview was completed)_ and also reflect on where I could improve when I was in similar interview situations in the future.

## Conclusion
- Do this! Its awesome! I highly encourage you to volunteer.  You will both be able to stay technical, provide support, and most importantly give back! Check out this site, reach out to me / Alexis to get started!  
- It was important to me to volunteer and give back. I interviewed a wide array of engineers. All driven and passionate candidates who were driven to push themselves. Many of the people I interviewed were women and under represented minorities. Our industry not only lacks diversity, but lacks support for diverse engineers once they are in the industry.
