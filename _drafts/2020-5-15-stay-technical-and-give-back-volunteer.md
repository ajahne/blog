## Outline for post
- Why it’s important to stay technical
- Why it’s important to give back
- How I got involved
- What I did to prepare
- How the interview process went

1:
- our industry changes so rapidly, learn or die. Nor physically, but career. Career progression will stagnant.
- What you do at work will not evcesarilybslign with the current trends and ways if the industry. Many moons ago I worked on adobe flash when it was dying. Recently was deep into Angular when React was eating the world. Even in my most recent interviews with JavaScript as my strongest language I needed to take time to brush up on data ya structures and algorithms.
- So stayungbtechjicsl is critical. As a manager? Even more so as our days are not spent coding or designing omg orbsrchtirecting. But rather coChing, executing, building teams, and setting direction.
- As I was deep in my interviewing processes for FAANGs, etc, technology is key “give quote from green book”
- I was rust before my deep studying and saw this as an opportunity to keep the learning going

2:
- to get to where I am I have stood on the shoulders of giants, had the support of family, armies of friends, professors, loved ones, coworkers and mentors of all flavors. I e we hold not be here without the support of others. I feel indebted and try as I can to pay it forward (as well as back) as often as I can. I mentor, I support the BSCS at Tufts, board member, and one of the core reasons I write this blog is to share the knowledge I have learned through your my career. Hoping this small gesture can pay back even some of the help you have gotten
- Representation maters. Seeing Pursuits mission and groove bing in their goals to help people find careers in this tech industry that under represents the world as it looks.
- Throughout the intrerbirws I met numerous underrepresented minorities and women in tech who were driven, hard working, and passionate about growing asvsiftware engineers.
- I hope busy seeing someone who looks like them that I was able to inspire even the smallest bit ofimspieation, then I have done even more than I could have hoped for. Humbled I would be.

3:
- I met Alexis, the head of volunteering at a networking event for engineering leaders in NYC. A pursuit fellow gave a presentation on their work, what they learned, and the impact it had. I was hooked
- I signed my name up as a volunteer and started from there
- A few months later we figure out a tome and what would aligned best with my skills. I decided to support them in their technical interview process.
- At the time I was deep in my own interview process. Interviewing for leadership positions at FAANGs, tier 1 tech companies, and growth stage startups.  I figured that helping out with interviews would both keep me sharp and help support fellows who were looking to break into the industry

4:
- For preparation, pursuit provide the volunteers with an overview of the program and a walthiugh of the interview process
- there was a list of technical questions prepared by the pursuit teams for us to take. Questions like this one and this one (nah, these ain’t the real questions, I ain’t giving you those. I have been sworn to secrecy)
- I wrote up answers to each of the questions in JavaScript, giving myself  the same amount of time as the candidates. Wanted to test myself :)
- I made sure I was familiar with each answer as well as the time and space complexity of optimal solutions.
- The great part is that the fellows take programs in either JavaScript or Swift. So some of the candidates posted their answers in swift which I am not familiar with. I took this a opportunity to brush up on Swift basics like it’s syntax, core data structures, and basics. While I am no swift expert, I can definitely knock out a bellow world or two and a few low level programming interview questions :)
- As I was studying for interviews during this time I was already familiar with this process. However as we were using Repl instead of white boards I want to make sure all of my code ran and compiled. Not time to write unit tests, but I did think about how I would test my solutions
- Once complete I checked
- We were given a GitHub and I checked the solutions against that
- I then checked the questions that would be asked and made sure I was comfortable with each

5:
- TBD
