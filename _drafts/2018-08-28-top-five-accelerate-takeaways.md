## Outline
### intro
  - the impact the book had on me
  - How it influenced me as a leader and engineer
  - what I have begun to implement at my organization

### Top 5 takeaways
- A collaborative, open culture is paramount
  - The authors found that companies with safer environments and better communication perform better
  - it is easier to change what people do, then to change what they think.  To change culture, work to change what people do
  - Create an inclusive organization; all organizational members feel welcome and valued for who they are and what they bring to the table
  - As a leader watch for (and address) harassment, microagressions, and unequal pay
  - Enable cross-functional collaboration: build trust with counterparts in other teams, encourage people to move between departments, actively seek and reward work that facilitates collaboration
  - Create a climate of learning: budget for books and conferences, make it safe to fail, lunch and learn, share with demo days
- Automation is key
  - Automate tests
  - Automate deployments
- Limit WIP
- Empower those with the knowledge
- Continuous Delivery is Key
  - Optimize for: deployment frequency, lead time for changes, Mean Time To Restore (MTTR), change failure rate
  - enabler of more frequent, higher quality, and lower-risk software releases
  - small batches
  - Desired outcome: teams can deploy to production on demand; fast feedback on the quality and deployability is available to everyone in the team
  - Investments in technology are also investments in people
  - CD makes work more sustainable (less deployment pain, less burnout)
  - Slice products and features into small batches that can be released in a week
  - CD creates a virtuous cycle - investments in technology and resources make the work better for our people, which makes them more motivated, identifying with the organization more, leading to move development - help reduce burnout
- Lean management and transformative Leadership is fundamental
  - Leadership doesnâ€™t mean you have people reporting to you on an organizational chart - leadership is about inspiring and motivating those around you
  - Lean management decreases burnout, leads to a more generative culture, and improves software delivery performance
  - Limiting WIP (looked it up) is about reducing the current work in progress to focus the team, reduce team overload, reduce context switching, locate bottlenecks faster
  - Approval by an external body does not correlate with any increased stability of production systems - it slows things down, shown to be worse than having no change approval process at all
  - Change acceptance board is risk management theatre
  - Team leader: limit work in process, eliminate roadblocks
  - 5 characteristics of a transformational leader: vision, inspirational communication, intellectual stimulation, supportive leadership, personal recognition
  - Invest in DevOps
  - Make deployments less painful
  - Connect strategic objectives of the business to the work teams do
  - Real value of a leader is amplifying the work of their teams
- continuously improve
  - High performing teams continue to get better each year
- Speed and stability is key
- Fix the culture can address burnout
- Make work sustainable
  - Reduce deployment pain: fear and anxiety related to pushing code to production
  - Managers often fix the employee while ignoring the environment (guilty)


Random thoughts:
- Note to self: change definition of done - done does not mean dev complete, done means all tests are written and code passes all tests (add documentation too?)
- Factors that predict high delivery performance:
goal-oriented generative culture
modular architecture
CD
effective leadership
- Knowledge is power and give it (power) to those who have knowledge
