## Scaling
- Document
- Delegate
- Coach / Grow your people
- Up-level yourself / team
- quick tips? (iterate on your calendar to free up time, move from 1-1 to 1->N)

Purpose
> to share some of my learning as a manager and how I have been able to successfully scale myself over time

First, what does it mean to "scale yourself"
To me this means...what?

what are symptoms you are not scaling yourself
- feeling burnt out at the end of the day, every days
- do not have thinking or heads down times
- all of your time is spent in meetings
- you are constantly being reactive, responding to things in real time vs having time to think, strategy and plan
- you are dropping tasks
- you are consistently working long hours and days
- You do not have time or have been unable to up-level engineers on your team (e.g. have not found mentorship opps for IC1 engineers, coach up your senior engineers)


Scale
- a multiplier for your team, cross-functional partners, and
- able to move from 1->1 impact to 1->N Impact
- Feel like I am missing something here...

The manager was pleased, they had bestowed the ultimate nugget of knowledge.

The meeting ended.

I was confused.

I need to do what exactly?


## But what did I do?
A previous manager who reported to me was looking to get to the next level. I observed that they seemed overwhelmed: responding to messages at 11pm, tasks getting dropped, what else?

^^^^^ How do I do this w/o having this person sounds like they need different coaching then "scale yourself"
In a recent 1-1 with a manager that reports to me, I had be

My response? You need to scale yourself

Wait...did I just to what was done to me previously?

Provide empty management slogans without providing the actual info?
