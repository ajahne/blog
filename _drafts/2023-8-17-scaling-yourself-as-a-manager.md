## Scaling
- Document
- Delegate
- Coach / Grow your people
- Up-level yourself / team
- quick tips? (iterate on your calendar to free up time, move from 1-1 to 1->N)

Purpose
> to share some of my learning as a manager and how I have been able to successfully scale myself over time

First, what does it mean to "scale yourself"
To me this means...what?

what are symptoms you are not scaling yourself
- feeling burnt out at the end of the day, every days
- do not have thinking or heads down times
- all of your time is spent in meetings
- you are constantly being reactive, responding to things in real time vs having time to think, strategy and plan
- you are dropping tasks
- you are consistently working long hours and days
- You do not have time or have been unable to up-level engineers on your team (e.g. have not found mentorship opps for IC1 engineers, coach up your senior engineers)


Scale
- a multiplier for your team, cross-functional partners, and
- able to move from 1->1 impact to 1->N Impact
- Feel like I am missing something here...
