## Scaling
- Document
- Delegate
- Coach / Grow your people
- Up-level yourself / team
- quick tips? (iterate on your calendar to free up time, move from 1-1 to 1->N)

Documentation
Coaching / training
Delegation

Documentation
- document the things you do and how to do them
- Create templates
- Create standard ways of doing things
- Examples: career ladder - how did this help? - clarity on levels and expectations, I was no longer the only won who could recommend a level, or advocate for a promotion. Additionally, this set clear expectations for all engineers, importantly getting this out and not just stuck in my head.
- Example: documenting hiring process - did I actually do this?
- Document my manager processes - key meetings to have as a manager - this was done around the time I was leaving previously company and needed to document a lot of processes for. Got experience and new manages on the team
- Expectations: AMPED - wanted to align folks on a clear strategy and set of goals for the team, instead of having n conversations with n team members, you can scale with a 1->N presentation and documentation both inspiring and setting vision
- Expectations: velocity doc I made for Shop


Purpose
> to share some of my learning as a manager and how I have been able to successfully scale myself over time

First, what does it mean to "scale yourself"
To me this means...what?

what are symptoms you are not scaling yourself
- feeling burnt out at the end of the day, every days
- do not have thinking or heads down times
- all of your time is spent in meetings
- you are constantly being reactive, responding to things in real time vs having time to think, strategy and plan
- you are dropping tasks
- you are consistently working long hours and days
- You do not have time or have been unable to up-level engineers on your team (e.g. have not found mentorship opps for IC1 engineers, coach up your senior engineers)


Scale
- a multiplier for your team, cross-functional partners, and the organization
- able to move from 1->1 impact to 1->N impact
- Feel like I am missing something here...


## Why am I writing this?
I had a manager tell me once: "you need to scale yourself". That was all they said. It came across as if it was the sagest gem of leadership ever spoken. Like wisdom dripped down from the mountaintops distilled into one crystalline droplet, from the management monks, who had meditated on the ultimate management proverbs while sitting high above in the cloudy peaks. 

The manager was pleased, they had bestowed the purest nugget of knowledge.

The meeting ended.

I was confused.

Wait, I need to do what exactly?


## But what did I do?
A previous manager who reported to me was looking to get to the next level. I observed that they seemed overwhelmed: responding to messages at 11pm, tasks getting dropped, what else?

^^^^^ How do I do this w/o having this person sounds like they need different coaching then "scale yourself"
In a recent 1-1 with a manager that reports to me, I had be

My response? You need to scale yourself

Wait...did I just to what was done to me previously?

Provide empty management slogans without providing the actual info?
