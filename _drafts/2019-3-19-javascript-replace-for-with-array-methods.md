Use cases for replacing for loops with Array methods

I want to find an element of an array - find
I want to find an index of an array -> findIndex
I want to modify elements of an array -> map
I want a subset of an array -> filter
I want to find the sum of all numbers -> reduce

Common cases to replace for loops with Array methods
- I want to find an element in an array aka needle in the haystack
- I want to find the index of a particular element in an array aka number of the needle in the haystack
- I want to sum of all numbers in an array aka how much hay is in my haystack
- I want a subset of array elements that match a condition aka I just want some of the hay
- I want to modify all elements of an array aka my analogy no longer holds
