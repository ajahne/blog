Use cases for replacing for loops with Array methods

- I want to find an element of an array - find
- I want to find an index of an array -> findIndex
- I want to modify elements of an array -> map
- I want a subset of an array -> filter
- I want to find the sum of all numbers -> reduce

## Common cases to replace for loops with Array methods
- I want to find an element in an array _aka needle in the haystack_

- I want to find the index of a particular element in an array _aka number of the needle in the haystack_
- I want to sum of all numbers in an array _aka how much hay is in my haystack_
- I want to change all elements in a list _aka change hay to grass_
- I want to determine if a particular value exists in an array
- I want a subset of array elements that match a condition _aka I just want some of the hay_
- I want to modify all elements of an array _aka my analogy no longer holds_
