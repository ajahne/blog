I'm a member of a monthly meetup of technologists from different organizations throughout the greater NYC area who are looking to become better leaders.  This is an excellent [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ctoschool/) of startup CTOs, VPs of Engineering, [Tech Leads]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-2-11-what-is-a-tech-lead %}), Entrepreneurs, Senior developers on the leadership path, individual contributors, and more.  

The monthly meetup is a forum to discuss challenges we face as leaders related to people management, process, and technology.  This month, the topic was scaling teams beyond NYC.

## outline
- intro
- what was the meeting

## Offshore vs distributed
Offshore vs distributed
- monolithic vs micro services
- More orchestration and monitoring
- Alert when things arevdevuating
- Give people what and why (pitch tech team like investors, product owner does it)
- Hard to motivate, hard to keep culture
- Can’t talk about why enough

- When a region is found you liked, hired a recruiter

### time zones
Time zones
- align people in a band
- Shift to pods based on time zones

## Staff Augmenter/Partner
- want to be a true extension of what you do in your organization
- Backlog out of the way
- Hard to find people
- Hard to get people; people can get salaries from Facebook and google
- Why am I outsourcing?
- What needs to get done?
- Need additional expertise
- Success has been in long term engagements
- Project by project basis - might not have the expertise
- Vendor: TGIF, partner: restaurant that pairs your wine with your meal

### how to make staff augmenter/partner work
- communication what’s the person working on? Skills required?
- “Overcomminicate”
- Partner
- Have stability in your organization
- Have the team visit your office
- Have you visit them
- Understand the culture of the company
- Visit with the people

### how to evaluate a partner
- communication
- Language
- TimeZome (is partner willing to extend hours to work with you)
- Budget
- Who is involved
- Escalation points?
- Hands on or hands off
- Team composition
- Management
- Interview
- Talk to delivery team, tech team

## Some keys to success (i.e. making this work)
- Understand local power structure, have a local partner
- Avoid it by - you are a sole contractor, works with a few people, found that critical mass was three
- Worked with countries that other people don’t wanna work in
- Hiring people without a strong CS background doesn’t work
- Junior developers doesn’t work
- If less than 7 years, then do not hire
- Takes a level or professional experience
- Do your diligence, research the company, laws and people
- Design the teams first to create the architecture you want to create
- Have to have good leadership in place. Need a partner you can trust?
- When distributed - learn local labor laws. Hire contractors, they start sole proprietor for the developers, creates them as exclusive contractor
- Getting teams independent, avoid spreading work amongst teams
- Vertically align teams to areas of business and make sure everyone they need is collocated
- Regularly send people from NYC to Belfast
- Document everything (e.g. "If not written down, it doesn't exist")

## creating a culture
- what do the people think about
- What do people feel
- How do we align with the culture
- Generally hiring in areas that do not have startups
- Bring people out to New York for 1-2 weeks
- Have video calls (put people’s camera on)
- People are social animals
- Need a balance between people who smile and people who are great engineers
- Find people who get and appreciate taking on the challenge
- Fly people back and forth

## management
- Video code reviews, not just code review bully
- One on one always video
- 360 email people that work with and collect it
- Anonymize it
- Constructive and reinforcing
- 180 days
- Team level
- Manager leave
- You as and execuiton person
- 90% is lead by person
- Then 360
- Then manager
- 2-4 hours per person
- Engineering managers of the partners
- If work with a partner do not do performance management
- At the end of the day do not employee them
- Would have to review if paying a hire rate

## challenges
- Architecture is hard - cannot share white board
- communication
- Found no matter what city, run into a scaling problem
- Price of developers overseas starts to rise
- Eventually everyone has a bench and a bench might run out. Team have people but not the people you need
- Never try them out, if fail the interview, do not just try them out
- Hiring in NYC
