> A tech lead is a senior engineer responsible for leading a team of software developers in achieving a shared objective.

Much has been written about this topic and there are doubtless the same number of tech lead definitions as there are technology companies and teams. With that in mind, two definitions resonated with me and helped enrich my perspectives on tech leads.

In her seminal book _The Manager's Path_, Camille Fournier states:
>"The tech lead role is not a point on the ladder, but a set pf responsibilities that any engineer
>may take on once they reach the senior level"

This is an important point as it outlines how someone may assume the role of tech lead for a particular project or business objective, but after a period of time, return to their "regular role", with someone else assuming the set of tech lead responsibilities. Further, this enables different engineers to assume the role at different times with the added benefit of letting people try out a leadership position, in order to see how they like it and perform.

She continues:

> A tech lead learning how to be a strong technical project manager, and as such, they are scaling themselves by delegating work effectively without micromanaging

For many tech leads new to the role, this is a new mindset and a challenge.  Oftentimes as engineers we are accustomed to performing all tasks ourselves.  However, as we gain seniority and responsibility, one of the keys ways to truly scale ourselves and the business is to learn how to delegate tasks and trust in our team mates to perform (and excel)!

Additionally, Patrick Kua succinctly defines a tech lead as:
>"A leader, responsible for (software) development team, who spends at least 30% of their time writing code with the team"

Building on this definition, I would add from personal experience that I want my tech leads to code at least 40-50% of the time! The reason is twofold:
1. The tech lead has sound technical skills that benefit the organization/team, we want her to use them!
2. When first trying out the role of "tech lead", some developers enter with trepidation of "losing their technical abilities".  As a manager, I want to make sure they are getting plenty of time to code!


## What makes a strong tech lead?
There are numerous skills that a strong tech lead must exhibit.  However, in my experience, if I were to break it down into two skills that help make a strong tech lead, they would be technical skills and the ability to communicate. While the technical skills are almost built into the title and requirements of the role itself, the ability to communicate - including the ability to listen - is paramount in an effective leader.

While it is expected the tech lead has strong technical skills, it would be a mistake to assume that a tech lead is simply the best of most experience developer on the team. People skills are equally - if not more - important than technical skills as the tech lead must coordinate with other leads, work with team members in other departments, break down technical problems to members of the team with different levels of experience, and communicate the "why" around a specific business problem, rationale, or solution.  

### Strong Technical Skills
- The tech lead has technical experience in a given field or discipline
- The tech lead has sufficiently developed in the software area (e.g. feature, Frontend component, DB, etc.) to

### Strong Communicator  
- listens to the team
- communicates effectively with management

- does not have to be the smartest or most experienced member of the team

## What are some specific tasks a tech lead my perform?
- Create, maintain, and update the project plan(s) based on current team status
- Create Project Plans and help set timelines
- Keep the team focused on the common goal
- Communicate project and team status to management

### If the tech lead managers or mentors developers, she may also be expected to:
- Conduct 1-1 meetings with members of the team
- Work with direct reports/mentees to provide career development feedback

## Musings and selected questions

### Is a tech lead a manager?
A tech lead can be a manager, but is not required to be so. If the tech lead is a manager, they are expected to conduct 1-1s, provide career development support, and adhere to the management responsibilities of the given organization.  

### Is a tech lead on the path to management?
While being a tech lead does not make one a manager, obtaining leadership experience is a prerequisite on the management career ladder.

### What if the tech lead does not like the the role, is she now stuck in it?
This depends on the organization, but in my experience, no. I prefer to give senior developers the opportunity to try their hand out at a leadership role and see how they like it and how they perform. If its a fit, great, if not, no worries. They key for any organization is having a solid career path that equally maps our the management **and** individual contributor path.

### A note on teams.
The role of a tech lead varies from organization to organization and even from team to team.  Some teams with more experienced members may need less guidance in certain areas and may even share responsibilities across the team. For example, one individual may be responsible for communicating to management, while another takes the lead on updating the project plan, while a third plays the role of a mediator. Ultimately we want to ensure high-performant teams that efficiently deliver and solve business problems in a scalable manner.
