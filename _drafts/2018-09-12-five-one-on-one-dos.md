## do switch them up
It is important to not let 1-1 meetings become monotonous.  Grab a coffee, go for a walk, switch up the location of the meeting - all of these will help keep the discussion and atmosphere fresh.  

Some suggestions include:
- taking your direct report out to lunch
- have your 1-1 in a coffee shop (and offer to buy the coffee/tea/juice)
- have a catchup over breakfast

- do focus on the moment and be present
- do take notes
- do come prepared
