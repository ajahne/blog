## General notes and thoughts Chapter 1-4

Not about the process, it’s about people holding each other accountable to the process
- Start with heart
- Start with yourself

> Goals quickly change to "winning. Avoid winning.

Focus on what you really want
- Pause, take a deep breath
- Name the game and stop playing it

Stop and ask yourself some questions
- What do I really want for myself/others/the relationship
- How would I behave if I really wanted this

## Chapter 4 - Learn to Look
- Reactions when crucial conversations are happening: silence and violence (when the conversation is not safe)
- Monitor yourself and your stress; how are your reacting? (Style under stress)
- Look at content and conditions, watch for safety problems (e.g. is someone in the conversation getting quiet or reacting with sarcasm)

## Chapter 5 - Make it Safe
- Build up trust and mutual purpose
- Others perceive you are working toward and common outcome and goals
- Find a shared goal and you have a good reason and climate to chat
- Is the conversation at risk? Ask two questions
  - Do they believe I care about their goals
  - Do they trust my motives
- Goal has to be truly mutual
- Examine your motives
- Start with heart ❤️
- Maintain mutual respect
- 3 things: apologize, contrast, find a mutual purpose
- Step out of the discussion and build safely
- Contrast: don’t and do; what I didn’t want tot do: clarify real purpose - explain what you didn’t intend then explain what you did intend
- Contrast is not apologizing

Four skills (crib)
- Commit to seek mutual purpose; start with heart - suspend beliefs that our solution is best and only one
- "It seems like we are both trying to win, I am committed to stay in this conversation until we find a mutual solution"
- Step out of context and find the ultimate goal food wants
Summary
- step out to make it safe
- Apologize when appropriate
- Use contrasts (say don’t intend they say what you do mean)
- Create a mutual purpose
- Commit
- Recognize
- Invent
- Brainstorm

## Chapter 6
- Take charge of your feelings
- You and only you create your emotions
- Find a way to master them or fall hostage to them
- Worst at dialogue - let emotions over take them; good at dialogue suppress emotions and keep conversation going, but eventually snap and react with silence or violence; best: act ON emotions, choose emotions to act upon and choose behaviors that create better results
- Path to action: see / hear -> tell yourself a story -> feeling -> action / behavior
- The best "slow down" - retrace your path to action
- Notice your behavior (are you silence or violence)
- Feel (identify your emotions)
- Tell a story - analyze a story
- See / hear - get back to the facts specific, objective, and verifiable: conclusions are subjective; watch for hot terms: eg scowl or sarcastic
- Watch for 3 clever stories: victim (me), villain (you, them), helpless (look forward)
- Don’t sell out avoid telling yourself clever stories
- Clever stories are incomplete
- Fill in the missing details
- Turn victims to actors, villains to humans , helpless to the able -> what would I do right now to get the best results, what do I really want
- Summary: find your self moving away from dialogue, stop and notice what you are doing / feeling (ie am I silent or violent); analyze conclusions and stories; get back to the facts; watch for clever stories and tell the full story; what do I want and what would I do now to get there

## Chapter 7
- Hearts need to be in the right place and are well prepared
- Express opinion - now what?
- Totally frank and completely respectful
- Maintain safety - confidence, humility, and skill
- Start with the facts
- Not trying to win the dialogue gathering facts is the homework required for crucial conversations
- "I’m not sure you’re intending to send this message, but it comes across like…"
- Rebuild safe try with contrasting; goal of contrasting is to be confident in what you want to express, not to apologize
- After you share…invite others to do the same
- Change the fact is to my opinion; soften it’s clear to me to I’m beginning to wonder if
- It’s leading me to conclude, I’m starting to feel like you don’t trust me, I don’t think you’re intending this but…
- Invite the opposition…what am I missing here?
- Learn to look when people start to resist (look at yourself and see what you are doing as well); more you care about something, the worst your behavior may be
- Passion can be your own enemy
- Stare your path; share facts l, tell your story, ask for others path, talk tentatively, encourage testing

## Chapter 8
- Safety at risk - step out and restore it
- If made a mistake - apologize
- If unclear - use contrast statements
- At odds - find a mutual purpose
- Cure for silence and violence: curiosity- do your best to get to root of fear or anger
- Be patient
- Try to retrace the other persons path to action
- Ask, mirror, paraphrase, prime = power listening tools
- Ask: what do you mean? I’d like to hear your opinions, don’t worry about my feelings, I’d like to know how you feel, what am I missing?
- Mirror:  suggest that while you are saying one thing, your tone or body posture suggest something else; manage your tone of voice and delivery, be calm; you seem angry at me, you see nervous about confronting him, are you sure you’re ok doing it?
- Paraphrase: put message in your own words: from what I’ve gathered….what I’m hearing is….do I have that right?
- Prime: pour meaning into the pool first: "are you thinking the reason we are doing this because…."; act of good faith and not the first thing to do
- "What do I really want"
- ABC
- Agree when you agree; start with the agreement
- Build; Absolutely and in addition to
-  Compare when you differ

## Chapter 9
- Making decisions: dialogue is not decision making
- Decide how to decide
- When line of authority is clear (eg there is a VP or manager, it’s clearer)
- When not a clear line of authority? Openly talk about who decides and why
- 4 Methods of decision making; command, consult, vote, consensus
- Important questions? Who cares about it? Who knows (who has the expertise)? Who must agree? How many people is it worth involving (do we have enough people to make a good choice)?
- When needed; have a crucial conversation about decision making practice
- Who does what by when and how will you follow up?
- Goals without deadlines aren’t goals, they are merely directions

## Chapter 10 - Examples
- Trust: deal with trust around the issue, not the person
- Work on "me" first - make things safe; separate intent from outcome; exercise patience
- Make it safe and state your path
- If you want someone to take more initiative; give examples and raise the bar; talk your expectations out
- Talk about the pattern, not just a specific instance (eg coming in late a lot, and someone says they will get better, then next time they come in late, it’s about keeping to their commitments, not just coming in late)
- Ok to suggest you need time alone and then hold a conversation at another time
- Do not suggest someone else take time, that can come across as patronizing

## Chapter 11
- To get started: **pick one skill to start or stay on principles**
- Learn to look: "are we in or out of dialogue"; are we playing games or are we in dialogue.
- Don’t have to be perfect to make progress

## Chapter 12 - Afterword
- Not just the big moments, small moments matter as well
- Learn / know yourself
- You don’t have to solve the crucial conversation, sometimes you just have to  bring it up in a safe way
- How true emotions can feel, but how false they can be
- Emotions can corrupt your view
- Don’t be driven by a need to be right
- Ask yourself "what do I really want".
- Use skills to develop habits, lives, and loves
