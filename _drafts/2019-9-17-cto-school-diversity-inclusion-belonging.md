The situation

Mickjinsey report

Why now?
- lots of data
- Easier to start today than tomorrow or next year

Running into “water problem”
Inclusion first - Cate Hudson

How do we hire more women? Hiring is the easiest part? There are groups that connect you

What happens after you higher them What about retention? It’s hard


Vision (American University)
Mission - create a company of Allies
Strategy - build awareness, provide education, enact change

Believe in the lives experiences of others.
See on radio: standpoint theory. Default, believe in the lives experiences of others. Invest time and money.

Say you will do something and then do it. Communivatebthe vision, mission, and strategy

Idea: discuss current events. How did you discuss current events? What was the forum?

Each week
- would do business reviews
- Wins type of meeting
- Discuss an event that happened (not a lot of engagement, but brought them up anyway)

People who speak up take extra hits.

Worked to diversify group through social network (eg follow new people on social media)

Celebrated the wins

Education
- created a reading list
- Allyship training (eg lunch and learn) - from Etsy

Effecting behavioral changes
- improve discourse (anything that was heard or seen would be discussed one-on-one); insensitive word choice, etc.; involved managers
- Removed Racist Slack Emojis; intent != impact
- Changed naming conventions (eg loglady)
- Inclusion debt

Compensation calibration
- quarterly
- Equal pay for equal work
- Career progression
-
Inclusivity as a point of performance
- demonstrated performance
- Set expectations at every level
- Chelsea Troy (Rubric of inclusion on career ladder)

How do I hire more women? I’m just a white dude, how do I do anything?

- Communicate

How can you measure it? Inclusion/belonging
- one on one discussions
- Surveys (anonymous) - survey monkey (inclusion)
- Retention
- Hiring

What’s your background?

Hire entry level - to find people from URMs

What prompted you to start?
- at Etsy
- Company was 50/50, 90% male engineering
-

Focusing on diversity and inclusion, improved everyone they hired

Focus on everyone
- have different people review resumes
- Remove names from resume
- Start from the bottom of the resume
- Remove your biases
- Get others involved, have people in your organization recommend people
- Communicate to your team
- Reach out to talent pools (women colleges, HBCUs)
- Don’t look down on job hopping
- Hire a service to review job specs to gendered language (textio)

Result in this company - wasn’t going to be a place where he could do his best work. Saw improvements.

Provide other opportunities to meetup, discuss, etc.

How do we increase the pipeline?
Increase the network, maybe we can mentorship. Any mentorship opportunities?

Look up different meetups
- go and become a mentor
- Sponsor someone

Some of the stuff is not salient
- Prepare people to be in the industry
