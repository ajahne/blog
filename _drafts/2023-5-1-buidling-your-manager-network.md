> We form like Voltron

# Outline
- opening - just say some things
- why is this important
- changing from IC to Manager
- examples of how I built my network
- how to go about building your net work

You need to form your crew! Building your network is one of my critical things to do to help you advance and grow in your career. Often times when making the transition from IC to manager, you may not have a strong network of managers to connect with. To build with, vent, chat, and learn from.

How did this help me?
When I was head of engineering at my previous company, I got to the point, where I did not have peers that I could chat with.  One I was the highest eng leader at the company, I could only chat with the CEO and COO. While this definitely helped me from a general coaching, mentorship, and strategic planning standpoint. there were times when I needed to discuss, problem solve, and learn more about engineering challenges.  

Questions such as:
- How do we move faster from execution standpoint?
- What does a high performing engineering team look like?
- How do I handle certain personnel challenges?
- How do I balance my time and delegate given my new / current responsibilities?
- How do I improve my team's velocity?
- What should a longer team engineering roadmap look like?

Again, while I had a coach and mentor during this time, there were certain _engineering_ framing or perspectives on some of these questions that required chatting with other folks in my discipline?

So what did I do?
I began researching different networks and groups on meetup (back when meeting in person was a thing). I found a CTO meet up and this helped my in a plethora ways:
- I would meet monthly with engineering leaders across NYC from CTOs, VPs, Directors, senior leaders, and ICs.
- I was added to a mailing list that I could throw questions into and get high-level responses
- I had people that I could reach out to directly (via email, cell) and ask questions to and share knowledge with.

This was helpful for me as I was at a startup and we did not have leadership training sessions, deep bench of experienced engineering managers, and we were often times were learning / do things on the fly.

This also helped me gain confidence, because I realized in this circle, I have knowledge and experience to share


Ways to build your Voltron?
- Find a meet up
- Ask your manager for recommendations
- Check out a few newsletter, podcasts, and join their networks
- Attend conferences
- Sign up for leadership trainings
- Ask your peers to meet

## Find a meet up
Are meets ups still a thing during COVID times? I need to look this up :D

While we are out of lock down, I leave it up to the reader to decide about attending meet ups.  As I mentioned above: I found great benefits in attending a meet up.

## Ask your peers to meet

So when I first started at Dropbox, I was in an Area with two other managers.  Our lead scheduled daily standups that allowed us to connect each day. Additionally, one of these managers was my onboarding buddy and helped me onboarded during my first 90 days at Dropbox.

We started a small book club, which fizzled out.  But the fact that we were able to set up connections that latest beyond manager changes, re-orgs, and re-locations.

After 3 years being at Dropbox, these two managers are still folks that I connect with at least once a month.  

This helped with me calibrating engineering ICs, working through performance or behavioral issue, roadmapping, or just venting

## Ask your manager
When I have worked with managers who are just starting out in the role or have recently been proomted to management, I have coached them to buildd their network. I have worked to pair them up with peers and mentors.
