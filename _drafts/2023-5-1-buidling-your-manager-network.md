> We form like Voltron

# Outline
- opening - just say some things
- why is this important
- changing from IC to Manager
- examples of how I built my network
- how to go about building your net work

You need to form your crew! Building your network is one of my critical things to do to help you advance and grow in your career. Often times when making the transition from IC to manager, you may not have a strong network of managers to connect with. To build with, vent, chat, and learn from.

How did this help me?
When I was head of engineering at my previous company, I got to the point, where I did not have peers that I could chat with.  One I was the highest eng leader at the company, I could only chat with the CEO and COO. While this definitely helped me from a general coaching, mentorship, and strategic planning standpoint. there were times when I needed to discuss, problem solve, and learn more about engineering challenges.  

Questions such as:
- How do we move faster from execution standpoint?
- What does a high performing engineering team look like?
- How do I handle certain personnel challenges?
- How do I balance my time and delegate given my new / current responsibilities?
- How do I improve my team's velocity?
- What should a longer team engineering roadmap look like?

Again, while I had a coach and mentor during this time, there were certain _engineering_ framing or perspectives on some of these questions that required chatting with other folks in my discipline?

So what did I do?
I began researching different networks and groups on meetup (back when meeting in person was a thing). I found a CTO meet up and this helped my in a plethora ways:
- I would meet monthly with engineering leaders across NYC from CTOs, VPs, Directors, senior leaders, and ICs.
- I was added to a mailing list that I could throw questions into and get high-level responses
- I had people that I could reach out to directly (via email, cell) and ask questions to and share knowledge with.

This was helpful for me as I was at a startup and we did not have leadership training sessions, deep bench of experienced engineering managers, and we were often times were learning / do things on the fly.

This also helped me gain confidence, because I realized in this circle, I have knowledge and experience to share


Ways to build your Voltron?
- Find a meet up
- Ask your manager for recommendations
- Check out a few newsletter, podcasts, and join their networks
- Attend conferences
- Sign up for leadership trainings
- Ask your peers to meet

## Find a meet up
Are meets ups still a thing during COVID times? I need to look this up :D

While we are out of lock down, I leave it up to the reader to decide about attending meet ups.  As I mentioned above: I found great benefits in attending a meet up.

## Ask your peers to meet

So when I first started at Dropbox, I was in an Area with two other managers.  Our lead scheduled daily standups that allowed us to connect each day. Additionally, one of these managers was my onboarding buddy and helped me onboarded during my first 90 days at Dropbox.

We started a small book club, which fizzled out.  But the fact that we were able to set up connections that latest beyond manager changes, re-orgs, and re-locations.

After 3 years being at Dropbox, these two managers are still folks that I connect with at least once a month.  

This helped with me calibrating engineering ICs, working through performance or behavioral issue, roadmapping, or just venting

## Ask your manager
When I have worked with managers who are just starting out in the role or have recently been proomted to management, I have coached them to buildd their network. I have worked to pair them up with peers and mentors.

Leverage your manager's network to find peers that you can connect with

## Check out news letters, pedocats, etc.

Here are a few podcasts, newsletter, and the liek that I have personaly found value in.  On each of these, once you sign up, there are ways you can sign up and get part of a group. This is almost like a "Vritual" meetup.  Allowing you to conenct, learn, and share with others.


## Attend conferences
Similar to finding a meetup, a great
 way to network and build your Voltron is to meet people at conferences.  You can connect with EMs that are attending, you can meet with the speaker, yyou can...

## Sign up for leadership trainings
At Dropbox, I am blessed to have the opportunity to join different leadership trainings.  I am actually on a plane now on my way to an engineering manager summit!

One of the benefits of attending leaership trainings are meeting other maanagers and leaders both in and our of your org.  I attended a training on high-performing managerment and during one of the breakout rooms was paired with senior managher who worked in a completedly differernt area the company. After our breakout, we set up monhtly meetings.  From this I was able to have someone to chat about re-orgs channges, managerment, challenges, improvement to Diversity in our DEI and more.

## Be proactive - set up time with your peers to me
ask your peers to meet.

Ask folks if they want to meet up?


## A few tips
- Cadence: I would recommend a cadence of bi-weekly or monthly as a Cadence.  Anything less frequent than this has the potential to lose momentum, anything more frequent may become too overwhelemding, or come at the cost of other meetings you may need to atteend, or potentially has less on the agenda.
- Voltron side: 2-4 folks.
- 1-1s or group meetings? I would encoourage a combination of both.  When it was most successufl for me is having both 1-1s with certain folks and joining broader management meetings. For example, I previously meet with a senior engineering manager peer bi-weekly and I also joined a monthly "NYC managers meeting".
