[Leaders are readers](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/95682-not-all-readers-are-leaders-but-all-leaders-are-readers) and with that in mind, I push myself to read as often as I can.  Recently I read ["The First 90 Days"](https://www.amazon.com/First-90-Days-Strategies-Expanded/dp/1422188612) and took notes throughout.  Below are my notes, gut reactions, and raw thoughts from each chapter.

## Chapter 5: Secure Early Wins
- keep your ends clearly in mind when you devise your plan to secure early wins
- Build waves of change that consist of: learning, designing the changes, building support, implementing the changes, observing results
- First wave of change is to secure early wins
- Start with the goal in mind, that is your anchor
    - Define your goals
    - Identify and support behavioral changes
- Page 120 had problematic behavior patterns (revisit this in 30 days)

  - Focus on a few promising opportunities
  - Get wins that matter to your boss
  - Get wins in the right ways
  - Take STARS portfolio into account
  - Adjust for the culture
- First 30 days, build personal credibility
- People will form opinions on you with very little data
- New leaders are perceived as more credible when they display the following characteristics
    - Demanding but able to be satisfied
    - Accessible but not too familiar
    - Decisive but judicious
    - Focused but flexible
    - Active without causing commotion
    - Willing to make tough calls, but humane

- When changing, need to decide if better to plan or conduct collective learning (ie experiment and see how it goes)
- NTS: create better, clearer benchmarks for success (outcome over output, but what is the desired outcome
- Ask questions to identify where potential problems may be lurking, set of questions on page 137
- NTS: the internal processes are a key area to start looking in
- Goal: creating a virtuous cycle that reinforces wanted behaviors and contributes to helping you achieve your agreed to goals for the organization

## Chapter 6: Achieve Alignment
- Understand the organizations hierarchy, structure, and systems
- Don‚Äôt make change for change‚Äôs sake
- Adjust for the STARS situation
- Four elements of organizational architecture:
  - strategic direction
  - structure
  - core processes
  - skill bases
- Goal for the first 90 days: identify potential misalignments and design a plan for correcting them
-   Page 146 and 147 have details on how to get started
- Strategic direction encompasses mission, vision, and strategy
  - Mission: what is achieved
  - vision: why people should feel motivation to perform at a high level
  - Strategy is how you get there
- Review page 148
- Assess the alignment
  - Assess coherence: look at documents that describes your groups mission, vision, and strategy
  - Assess adequacy: is what your group is working in sufficient for the group to succeed and to help the larger company succeed for 2-3 years
  - Ask probing questions, prove the history of how the strategic direction got defined
  - Assess implementation: have the mission vision and strategy been pursued energetically
- Does the structure support the strategy?
- NTS: Revisit page 154 and write out these areas
- Every org structure has trade offs
  - Make the right trade offs? E.g. Innovation or flawless execution?
- What are our core processes? Review page 159
- Align processes with structure
- To evaluate efficiency and effectiveness of a core process, examine for aspects: productivity, timeliness, reliability, quality (p160)
- Treat processes like a portfolio, focus on a few at a time. Take care to factor in your organizations, capacity for change
- Key takeaway from this chapter: it is critical to identify the mission, strategy, and core processes of your team (group, unit, etc)

## Chapter 7: Build Your Team
- Assess existing team members; Align and motivate them; establish new processes to promote team work
- Avoid common traps:
    - do not criticize people who led before you arrived, nothing to gain from this, evaluate the impact, concentrate on assessing current behavior;
    - keeping the existing team too long, establish deadlines and conclusions about the team in first 90 days
    - Not balancing stability and change: find the right balance
    - Not working on organizational alignment and team development in parallel, be sure to understand the destination, route, and ship, captain üë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è.  
    - Not holding on to the good people
    - Undertaking team building before the core is in place; avoid explicit team-building activities until the team you want is largely in place
    - Making implementation decisions to early
    - Trying to do it all yourself
- Page 170 has a chart on how to synchronize architectural alignment and team restructuring
- Between day 30 and 60, sort out who is who, what roles people have played, and how the group has worked in the past
- Establish your evaluative criteria: competence, judgement, energy, focus, relationships, trust (refer to page 171)
- Be sure to: factor in the STARS matrix, criticality of positions, functional experience, extent of team work...most importantly check your assumptions
- Assess both the positions and the players
- Get historical data on past performance (performance reviews, etc)
- Meet 1-1 to assess team performance. Essentially I should meet and learn everyone, getting to know them personally, then understand how they work and their questions / abilities from an execution standpoint - great questions on page 176
- Test their judgment? (Not sure if I agree with the way this one is framed. I believe this could be confrontational and maybe feel like a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù for the employee)
- Assess the team as a whole
    - Study the data: reports of team meetings, Jira, previous release targets, morale surveys
    - Systematically ask questions: assess responses to the questions and see how they align or don‚Äôt align
    - Probe group dynamics: how do people interact? Alliances? Attitudes?
- Evolve the team, after 30 days should be able to assign people to the following categories: note. I think 30 days is very aggressive. Half of your first few days of onboarding, will not even be able meet with team members. So the question is ‚Äúwhen does the clock tick on 90 days‚Äù
- Categories
    - Keep in place
    - Keep and develop
    - Move to another position
    - Replace (low priority)
    - Replace (high priority)
    - Observe for a while
- Aligning your team
- Ensure a combination of push (goals, performance measurement, incentives) and pull (compelling vision, inspiring people)
  - NTS: I am better at pull than I am at push. Push helps execution, need to work on this
- Define quantifiable goals and metrics
- Incentive equation (a bit early I think to get into this, but worth revisiting p184)
- Articulate your vision. It should: tap into a source of inspiration, make people part of ‚Äúthe story‚Äù, contains evocative language (e.g. provide in graphic detail the vision, e.g. putting a man on the moon and landing them safely vs launching 10 rockets into space - this is vision vs goal respectively)
- It is critical to live in the vision you create! You must walk the walk
- For team building, refer to the offsite planning check list
- Leading your team
- Assess what worked well and did not work well before the team arrived
- Assess existing processes: participants roles, team meetings, decision making, leadership style
- Have a framework for deciding how decisions get made. Not all decisions should be made the same way (good insight for me)
  - E.g. We may need to alter team meetings. Make meetings smaller and more focused
- Two key decision making approaches ‚Äúconsult and decide‚Äù and ‚Äúbuild consensus‚Äù. Separating information gathering from evaluating and reaching closure, is consult and decide. When you seek both information and seek buy-in from everyone, then it‚Äôs build concesndus.
  - NTS: I think I typically lean towards consult and decide, but this might be a blind spot
- Rules of thumb:
  - Decisions that bias winners and losers, highly decisive, sharing losses and pain, are best made by the leader
  - If decision requires energetic support to implement by people whose performance you cannot adequately observe and control, build consensus
  - If team is inexperienced: consult and decide
  - If need to establish authority, consult and decide
  - However, take the STARS matrix into account. Startups may need more consult and decide. Realignment and sustaining success, leaders deal with strong intact teams, and confront cultural and political issues - typically better addressed with building consensus  

## Chapter 8: Create Alliances
- Build up relationships with people you have no direct control over
- Recognize when your new role presents you with different influence challenges from those you experienced in the past
- Need to influence in different ways: through persuasion and alliance building
- Identify who you need to influence, who is likely to support (or resist) your key initiatives is an integral part of 90 day plan
- Define your include objectives
    - First step: be clear about why you need the support of others, think about the alliances you need to secure early wins
    - Consider creating an alliance-building plan for each early win project
    - Try to identify who or what might stand in your way of getting support for your direction?
- Understand the influence landscape: who are the key decision makers? What do you need them to do and when do you need them to do it?
- Determine decision makers for your early wins
- Who are the winning alliances? Who are the blocking alliances
- Map the influence networks: who influences whom on issues of concern to you
- Strategy to map influence networks: identify key points of contact between your organization and others; get your boss to connect you to key stakeholders
- When you identify support, solidify and nurture it
- Take time to think about the forces acting on the people you want to influence
- Analyze the influencer network
- Assess people‚Äôs intrinsic motivations (the need for recognition, for control, for power, personal growth, etc)
- There is a lot of research that suggests we overestimate personality and underestimate the impact of situational pressures in reaching conclusions about the reasons people act the way they do
- Table for argument framing on page 215

## Chapter 9: Manage Yourself
- Take stock of yourself and note the many things that might be in transition (new job, move to a new city, new apt, baby on the way, etc)
- Go through the guidelines for structured reflection (page 223)
- It‚Äôs ok to have an emotional roller coaster; it‚Äôs common for leaders to go into the valley 3-6 months after starting
- NTS: be clear to establish boundaries: what can you and what can you not do? Reflect on this. Work avoidance?
- 3 pillars: adopt a 90 day plan; develop personal disciplines; build your support systems
- Plan to plan: at the end of each day, spend 10 minutes evaluating how well you met your goals, and then plan for the next day
- Don‚Äôt let urgent crowd out the important
- Carve out time to focus, focus, focus
- Defer commitment: say ‚Äúlet me think about it and get back to you‚Äù;
  - NTS: I think I over commit sometimes
  - begin with ‚Äúno‚Äù, if pressed, easier to say yes later.
- Find time to check-in with yourself. Maybe daily or weekly? How are you doing? How are you feeling?
- Recognize when to quit
- Build your advice and counsel network

## Chapter 10: Accelerate Everyone
- make a 90 day plan for the entire team
- Identify the transitions happening on your company, team, etc.
- don‚Äôt stay in your comfort zone, don‚Äôt try to do too much to fast
- Great chart that highlights some reasons for transition failure on page 245
- Setup time with leaders to put action oriented / coaching meetings on the calendar to carve out time for them to make their 90 plans, engage in reflection, etc.
- NTS: work to define what successful execution looks like?
- NTS: spend time, assessing the business and the new role, create / update the strategy to build momentum, create a strategy for managing myself, develop and action plan
- Fill out the development grid on page 256
